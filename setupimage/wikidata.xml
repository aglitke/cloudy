      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:NASA TRL Meter.jpg|frame|right|NASA Technology Readiness Levels]]
'''Technology Readiness Level''' (TRL) is a measure used by some [[United States government]] agencies and many of the world's major companies (and agencies) to assess the [[Mature technology|maturity of evolving technologies]] (materials, components, devices, etc.) prior to incorporating that technology into a system or subsystem. Generally speaking, when a new technology is first [[invention|invented]] or conceptualized, it is not suitable for immediate application. Instead, new technologies are usually subjected to [[experiment]]ation, refinement, and increasingly realistic testing. Once the technology is sufficiently proven, it can be incorporated into a [[system]]/[[subsystem]]. 

==Definitions==
Different definitions are used by different agencies, although they are somewhat similar. The most common definitions are those used by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).

|-
|-
! Technology Readiness Level || Description
|-
| 1. Basic principles observed and reported || Lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development. Example might include paper studies of a technology's basic properties.
|-
| 2. Technology concept and/or application formulated || Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. The application is speculative and there is no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumption. Examples are still limited to paper studies.
|-
| 3. Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept || Active research and development is initiated. This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative.
|-
| 4. Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment || Basic technological components are integrated to establish that the pieces will work together. This is &quot;low fidelity&quot; compared to the eventual system. Examples include integration of 'ad hoc' hardware in a laboratory.
|-
| 5. Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment || Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly. The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the technology can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include 'high fidelity' laboratory integration of components.
|-
| 6. System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment || Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond the breadboard tested for TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment. Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a prototype in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment.
|-
| 7. System prototype demonstration in an operational environment || Prototype near or at planned operational system. Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring the demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment, such as in an aircraft, vehicle or space. Examples include testing the prototype in a test bed aircraft.
|-
| 8. Actual system completed and 'flight qualified' through test and demonstration || Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development. Examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications.
|-
| 9. Actual system 'flight proven' through successful mission operations || Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation. In almost all cases, this is the end of the last &quot;bug fixing&quot; aspects of true system development. Examples include using the system under operational mission conditions.

|-
|-
!Technology Readiness Level || Description
|-
| 1. Basic principles observed and reported || This is the lowest &quot;level&quot; of technology maturation. At this level, scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development.
|-
| 2. Technology concept and/or application formulated || Once basic physical principles are observed, then at the next level of maturation, practical applications of those characteristics can be 'invented' or identified. At this level, the application is still speculative: there is not experimental proof or detailed analysis to support the conjecture.
|-
| 3. Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept || At this step in the maturation process, active research and development (R&amp;D) is initiated. This must include both analytical studies to set the technology into an appropriate context and laboratory-based studies to physically validate that the analytical predictions are correct. These studies and experiments should constitute &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; validation of the applications/concepts formulated at TRL 2.
|-
| 4. Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment || Following successful &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; work, basic technological elements must be integrated to establish that the &quot;pieces&quot; will work together to achieve concept-enabling levels of performance for a component and/or breadboard. This validation must be devised to support the concept that was formulated earlier, and should also be consistent with the requirements of potential system applications. The validation is &quot;low-fidelity&quot; compared to the eventual system: it could be composed of ad hoc discrete components in a laboratory.
|-
| 5. Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment || At this level, the fidelity of the component and/or breadboard being tested has to increase significantly. The basic technological elements must be integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the total applications (component-level, sub-system level, or system-level) can be tested in a 'simulated' or somewhat realistic environment.
|-
| 6. System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (ground or space) || A major step in the level of fidelity of the technology demonstration follows the completion of TRL 5. At TRL 6, a representative model or prototype system or system - which would go well beyond ad hoc, 'patch-cord' or discrete component level breadboarding - would be tested in a relevant environment. At this level, if the only 'relevant environment' is the environment of space, then the model/prototype must be demonstrated in space.
|-
| 7. System prototype demonstration in a space environment || TRL 7 is a significant step beyond TRL 6, requiring an actual system prototype demonstration in a space environment. The prototype should be near or at the scale of the planned operational system and the demonstration must take place in space.
|-
| 8. Actual system completed and 'flight qualified' through test and demonstration (ground or space) || In almost all cases, this level is the end of true 'system development' for most technology elements. This might include integration of new technology into an existing system.
|-
| 9. Actual system 'flight proven' through successful mission operations || In almost all cases, the end of last 'bug fixing' aspects of true 'system development'. This might include integration of new technology into an existing system. This TRL does ''not'' include planned product improvement of ongoing or reusable systems.

===ESA definition===

Instruments and spacecraft sub-systems are classified according to a &quot;Technology Readiness level&quot; (TRL) on a scale of 1 to 9. Levels 1 to 4 relate to creative innovate technologies pre or during mission assessment phase. Levels 5 to 9 relate to existing technologies and to missions in definition phase.

|-
|-
!Technology Readiness Level || Description
|-
| TRL 1. || Basic principles observed and reported
|-
| TRL 2. || Technology concept and/or application formulated
|-
| TRL 3. || Analytical &amp; experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of-concept
|-
| TRL 4. || Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment
|-
| TRL 5. || Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment
|-
| TRL 6. || System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment (ground or space)
|-
| TRL 7. || System prototype demonstration in a space environment

| TRL 8. || Actual system completed and &quot;Flight qualified&quot; through test and demonstration (ground or space)
|-
| TRL 9. || Actual system &quot;Flight proven&quot; through successful mission operations
|-
|}

If the TRL is too low, then a mission risks being jeopardized by delays or cost over-runs. It is a responsibility of the Advanced Studies and Technology Preparation Division to promote the technology readiness at a very early stage in order to make new missions feasible.

===Other definitions===
The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) references Technology Readiness Levels in some of their documents, and seems to rely on the NASA definitions.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is drafting Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) for medical countermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats.

==Integration Readiness Level and System Readiness Level ==


The Systems Development &amp; Maturity Laboratory at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] has developed an Integration Readiness Level (IRL) that works with TRL to determine a Systems Readiness Level (SRL).  They have also used these metrics to develop advanced models in cost and schedule planning.  Further research is being conducted in what they call Systems Earned Readiness Management (SERM).  Learn more about the work of the Systems Development &amp; Maturity Laboratory at [http://www.SystemReadinessLevel.com]

==Brief history of Technology Readiness Levels==
Technology Readiness Levels were originally developed by NASA in the 1980s. The original definitions only included seven levels. These were later expanded to nine levels.

'''Original NASA TRL Definitions by Sadin, et al., 1989 (Source: Nolte 2003)'''
:Level 1	Basic Principles Observed and Reported
:Level 2	Potential Application Validated
:Level 3	Proof of Concept Demonstrated, Analytically and/or Experimentally
:Level 4	Component and/or Breadboard Laboratory Validated
:Level 5	Component and/or Breadboard Validated In Simulated or Real-space Environment
:Level 6	System Adequacy Validated In Simulated Environment
:Level 7	System Adequacy Validated In Space

According to Ray Chase of ANSER, the TRL methodology was originated by Stan Sadin at NASA Headquarters in 1974. Mr. Chase states that Stan Sadin needs to be recognized as the initial developer of the TRL methodology. At that time Mr. Chase worked at JPL. He was the JPL Propulsion Division representative on the Jupiter Orbiter design team. At the suggestion of Stan Sadin he used his methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed JPL Jupiter Orbiter spacecraft design. Later Mr. Chase spent a year at NASA Headquarters helping Mr. Sadin institutionalize the TRL methodology. In 1978 Mr. Chase joined ANSER. Subsequently he used the TRL methodology to evaluated the technology readiness of proposed Air Force development programs. He published several articles during the 1980s and 90s on reusable launch vehicles, which used the TRL methodology to assess technology readiness. He used an expanded version of the methodology that included design tools, test facilities, and manufacturing readiness on the Air Force Have Not program. Design tools, test facilities, and manufacturing were important additions to the TRL methodology. The Have Not program manager, Greg Jenkins, and Mr. Chase published the expanded version of the TRL methodology, which included design and manufacturing. Leon McKinney and Mr. Chase used the expanded version to assess the technology readiness of the ANSER teams HRST concept. Recently ANSER has been using an adapted version of the TRL methodology on proposed Homeland Security Agency programs.  

The [[United States Air Force]] adopted the use of Technology Readiness Levels in the 1990s. 

In 1995, John C. Mankins, NASA, wrote a &quot;White Paper on Technology Readiness Levels&quot; that discussed NASA’s use of TRLs and proposed descriptions for each TRL. In 1999, the United States [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO) produced an influential report [[#References|GAO/NSIAD-99-162]] that examined the differences in [[technology transfer|technology transition]] between the DOD and private industry. It concluded that the DOD takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry. The GAO concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk. The GAO recommended that the DOD adopt the use of NASA's Technology Readiness Levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition. In 2001, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of TRLs in new major programs. Guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the Defense Acquisition Guidebook. Subsequently, the DOD developed detailed guidance for using TRLs in the 2003 DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook.

==TRL assessment tools==
A [[#External Links|Technology Readiness Level Calculator]] was developed by the [[United States Air Force]] by Nolte et al. This tool is a standard set of questions implemented in Microsoft ''Excel'' that produces a graphical display of the TRLs achieved. This tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TPMM Process Icon.jpg]] --&gt;[[Image:TPMM transition mech.jpg|right|TPMM Transition Mechanism]]The [[#External Links|Technology Program Management Model (TPMM)]] was developed by the [[United States Army]] by [[#Online|Craver et al.]]. The TPMM is a [[TRL]] gated high-fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist Technology Managers in planning, managing, and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition.  The model provides a core set of activities including [[systems engineering]] and [[program management]] tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals.  This approach is comprehensive, yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model.

==Uses of Technology Readiness Levels==
{{verify|list of advantages and disadvantages|date=February 2008}}
The primary purpose of using Technology Readiness Levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology. Advantages include:
:*Provides a common understanding of technology status
:*Risk management
:*Used to make decisions concerning technology funding
:*Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology

Disadvantages include:
:*More reporting, paperwork, reviews
:*Relatively new, takes time to influence the system
:*[[Systems engineering]] not addressed in early TRLs

'''Technology Genre''' is an [[Australia]]n expression based on the notion that all [[technology|technologies]] present a basic repeatable pattern of essential elements known as the elements of [[technacy]], and that similar configurations of elements that create similar patterns represent the Technological Genre. 

The proposition holds that if all technologies display no less than the [[technacy]] elements in a specific relationship, then each technology both known and newly developed in the future will also display the same basic minimum pattern of interacting elements.

All technologies tend to present more sophistication than these 4 elements, but no technology presents less than these elements.  As such, these basic elements are common and fundamental to all technologies and so technology genre.

==Technacy Elements==
# '''Purpose and Context''' (all technologies are produced, maintained or used in an initial or intended context with at least an initial purpose in mind. Thus the applied context and purpose requires careful consideration in design, development and its life cycle)
# '''Agent'''  (In this example, the human agent. Thus by definition, all human technological processes at some stage, are tied to individual, social and cultural influence)
# '''Tool''' (or '''tool systems''' whether abstract tools like algorithms or computer applications or physical tools like hammers or machines)
# '''Material''' (consumables, data, the thing being shaped, altered by the 'tool' via the knowledge or method of the agent).

==Different Technology Genre==
All technologies display 'at least'  the above 4 elements in a system, as such we can understand genres of technology by the substitutes in this system:

Eg Genre A: Textiles Technology

# Typical Purposes include apparel and non-apparel use of fabric to function in various set contexts
# Typical agent (human) elements include: knowledge or methods of sewing, stitching, pattern development of fabrics 
# Typical tools include needles, pins, sewing machines of various caliber and specialties 
# Typical materials include fabrics, weave, thread, fibre

Eg Genre B: Wood Craft Technology
#Typical Purposes include 3D physical forms (eg, furniture/sculpture, prototyping) in various set contexts 
# Typical agent (human) elements include: knowledge or methods of joinery, carving, design and development of timber form 
# Typical tools include power tools for timber, nails, screws, hammer, machines of various caliber and specialities 
# Typical materials include timbers if various species

Eg Genre C: Information/Communication Technology
# Typical Purposes include data or information management,  or design including creative designs. 
# Typical agent (human) elements include: knowledge or methods of such processes as data base design and presentation, systems management, document management and dissemination over internet, image file enhancements. 
# Typical tools include power data base tools, photo manipulation tools, web presentation, CAD and design tools. 
# Typical materials include digital file types to be shaped by the above tools like: text and numerical data, images, video, vector files, and their sub groups like Txt, html, various image formats, RTF, PDF etc.  Each requiring a blend of tool and method from both textile and information technologies.
 Mixed Genré to explore Innovations

Eg Genre A+B: Textiles and Wood Craft Technology

# Typical Purposes include Comfortable Furniture in set contexts of living room 
# Typical agent (human) elements include: knowledge or methods of sewing, stitching, pattern development of upholstery 
# Typical tools include textiles and wood tools 
# Typical materials include fabrics and wood

Eg Genre A+C: Textiles and Information/Communication Technology

# Typical Purposes include Fashion graphics in context of defined style or market 
# Typical agent (human) elements include: knowledge or methods of sewing, stitching, and image and design presentations  to client
# Typical tools include fashion software with digital image tools 
# Typical materials include fashion fabric textures (digital) with image format files.

==Innovation via mixing Genres of Technology==
Technological Genre is a way of communicating the differences between various technologies and offers a way for exploring and experimenting with mixed combinations of genrés to assist innovation processes.

In industry, a '''fabricator''' is a person or business that frames, shapes, or fashions something. A '''surface fabricator''' shapes surfaces.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Fabricate.gif]] --&gt;

== Types ==
For interior spaces, surfaces include solid coverings or decking for floors or walls, and countertops for kitchens, bathrooms, and workspaces. '''Natural surfaces''' are composed of naturally occurring materials like wood, stone, mineral, clay, gum and resin. '''Synthetic surfaces''' contain, in addition to any natural materials, man-made substances such as metal alloys or polymers. '''Solid surfaces''' are synthetic surfaces manufactured from polymeric materials.

Surface fabrication, as a distinct professional enterprise, usually involves complex tasks of surface shaping. A leading case is
[[countertop]] fabrication. There are professional associations for surface fabrication, such as the [http://www.issfa.net International Solid Surface Fabricators Association], [http://www.THEFABRICATORNETWORK.COM The Fabricator Network.com] and [http://www.solidsurfacealliance.org Solid Surface Alliance. org].

== Properties ==
Desirable properties of fabricated surfaces include durability (resistance to scratches, stains, heat, pressure), smoothness, warmth, [[Translucent|translucence]], and an active design which involves variation in color, shape or texture. Also desired is a harmonious and efficient integration with other components of interior design, including [[sink]]s, [[bathtub|bath]]s and [[stoves]]. Solid surfaces have many of these properties, and are typically less costly and easier to care for than premium natural surfaces such as granite. Advantages of natural surfaces include translucence, spectacular variation in texture and color, and durability.

== Tools ==
Tools of surface fabrication include [[drill]]s, templates, clamps, [[oven]]s, power grips, plunge saws and table saws. For all but the simplest jobs, surface fabrication usually takes place in the workshop, after which the finished product is assembled and installed at the work site.
Installation of multi-part surfaces often involves complex work with specialized tools, to create a seamless result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Coalescer''' is a technological device performing [[Coalescence (meteorology)|coalescence]]. They are primarily used to separate [[emulsion]]s in to their components via various processes; operating in reverse to an [[emulsifier]].

A coalescer can be divided into mechanical and electrostatic coalescers. Mecanical coalescers use filters or baffles to make droplets coalesce while electrostatic coalescers use DC or AC electric fields (or combinations). 

==Mechanical Coalescers==
In the area of compressed air purification, coalescing filters are used to separate liquid water and oil from compressed air using a coalescing effect. These filters additionally remove particles. The most commonly used media in this case is Borosillicate micro-fiber.

In the Oil and Gas, Petrochemical and Oil Refining industries, Liquid-Gas coalescers are widely used to remove water and hydrocarbon liquids to &lt;0.011 ppmw (plus particulate matter to &lt;0.3&amp;nbsp;um in size) from natural gas to ensure natural gas quality and protect downstream equipment such as compressors, gas turbines, amine or glycol absorbers, molecular sieves, PSA's, metering stations, mercury guard beds, gas fired heaters or furnaces, heat exchangers or gas-gas purification membranes.

liquid-liquid coalescers can also be used to separate hydrocarbons from water phases such as oil removal from [[produced water]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opusplus.co.uk/technology.php?pID=18 | Coalescer Equipment Vendor&lt;/ref&gt;. They have been also used in pyrolysis gasolene (benzene) removal from quench water in ethylene plants, although in this application, the constant changing of cartridges can lead to operator exposure to BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylene), as well as disposal issues and high operating costs from frequent replacement.

==Electrostatic coalescers==

Electrostatic coalescers use electrical fields to induce droplet coalescence in water-in-crude-oil emulsions to increasing the droplet size. The squared dependence
of droplet diameter in stokes law, increase the settling speed and destabilizes the emulsion. The effects on the water droplet arise from the very different dielectric properties of the conductive water
droplets dispersed in the insulating oil. Water droplets have a permittivity that is much higher than the surrounding oil. Furthermore, water with dissolved salt is also a very good conductor. When a uncharged droplet is subjected to a AC electric field  the field will polarize the droplet creating a electric field around the droplet to counteract the external field. As the water droplet is very conductive the induced charges will reside on the surface. The droplet has no net charge but one positive and one negative side. Inside the droplet the electric field is zero. When to droplets with induced dipoles gets close to each other they will experience an force pulling the droplets closer until they coalesce.   

In oil production co-produced water is mixed with the oil in choke valves and process equipment producing water-in-oil emulsions. The amount of water increases during the production life of the reservoir. The emulsions are destabilized using gravitational separators, and the settling rates are increased by applying heat, demulsifiers, and AC electric fields. The AC electric field gives rise to attractive forces between water drops and increases the probability of coalescence at contact. According to Stokes law, the settling rate increase proportionally with the square of the drop diameter. By promoting coalescence of small water droplets the settling rate can be greatly increased. The water content is normally reduced to &lt;0.5 vol% if this is the final treatment stage before the crude oil is exported. 

Typical electrocoalescers are large settling tanks containing electrodes and operates under laminar-flow conditions with bare electrodes that may be vulnerable to short circuiting. An alternative to this type of coalescer is a flow through pre-coalescer that is installed upstream a separator tank. In the [[Compact Electrostatic Coalescer]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tekna.no/ikbViewer/Content/19748/Einar%20E%20Johnsen%20-%20Glitne.pdf | Compact Electrostatic Coalescer Conference Paper&lt;/ref&gt;.  droplet coalescence is achieved by applying AC electric fields (50-60 Hz) to water-in-oil emulsions under turbulent-flow conditions. The turbulence increases the collision frequency between the water drops. The electrodes are insulated to prevent short circuiting, and permits water contents of up to 40% as well as water slugs. The equipment is a separate flow-through electrostatic treatment section installed upstream of a gravity separator to improve the performance. By keeping the treatment and settling sections separate a compact electrostatic coalescer are obtained that can also be retrofitted. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.akersolutions.com/Internet/MediaCentre/Featurestories/OilandGas/Makingeverydropcount.htm | Compact Electrostatic Coalescer Equipment Vendor&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Liquid-liquid coalecers are also widely used in oil refining industry to remove the last traces of contaminants like amine or caustic from intermediate products in oil refineries and also for the last stage dewatering of final products like kerosene (jet fuel), LPG, gasolene and diesel to &lt;15 ppmw free water in the hydrocarbon phase. These coalescers are often electrostatic type, in which an DC electrical field encourages the water droplets to coalesce and settle by gravity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technacy''' is the ability to understand, skillfully apply and communicate creative and 'balanced' technological solutions that are based on understanding the contextual factors involved. The Australian meaning of technacy is as a theoretical 'model' of technological activity.  It implies a deep (critical) knowledge of the nature of technologies as systems, or phenomena or simply as a comprehensive prowess in specific technologies, especially if understood in the context of their application.

It is that ability to show an holistic understanding of technology, and make rounded judgements for effective and usually sustainable technological solutions.  Not to be confused with technological literacy, which has a variety of meanings world-wide from skilled use of computers, to the ability to know and use the technical language for a [[Technological Genre]] (eg Australian NSW Board of Studies definition), to a broad scientific and technological orientation of knowledge as suggested by the [http://www.iteaconnect.org/TAA/TAA.html International Technology Education Association](ITEA)'s definition or via the Wiki entry on [[Technological literacy]].  Technacy, in Australian literature, is the name of a specific theoretical framework for understanding technological activity whereas Technological Literacy, as noted above, is not based on a theoretical framework, but rather is used as a broad expression for a range of ideas around technology and associated interpretations of desired capabilities.  To this end they are complementary concepts.

Technate people study the context of a technological problem in a comprehensive way before selecting the knowledge, tools and resources needed to progress a solution. This comprehensive assessment is critical to the success of the solution. Generally, being technate is demonstrating the ability to develop 'balanced' solutions based on a collection of key ideas within the context (see below for the four minimum technacy elements). Therefore, technate people successfully solve technological problems - whether in computing or product design - as they have clearly considered the purpose and context for the end use of the developed solution.

==Literacy, Numeracy, Technacy - Comparative Metaphors ==

Technacy is to the study of technologies, as [[literacy]] is to the study of languages, and [[numeracy]] is to the study of mathematics.

As with [[literacy]], where there are functional levels to being literate (signing your name, basic reading and comprehension) to sophisticated levels (powerful and effective poetry, comprehension of complex constructs in meaning and context), so too in technacy there are functional levels to being technate (skilled and knowledgeable in use of basic tools for a job, use of basic software to perform a task) to sophisticated levels (design and develop or evaluate appropriate technology solutions that are sustainable for specific and complex contexts in place or time).  

And like [[literacy]] where there are various [http://www.literacymatters.com/texttypes.html &quot;text types&quot;] to master (such as narrative, transactional, procedural and persuasive texts, recounts, reports and explanations), so too in technacy there are various [[Technological Genre]] of technology knowledge that may be mastered (such as Information and Communication Technologies, Timber Technologies, Metal technologies, Composite based Technologies (plastics), Electrical technologies, Food Technologies, Textiles Technologies, or Human Management Systems as technologies and so on).  These [[Technological Genre]] are commonly presented in the form of trades and technical faculties in schools, colleges and universities.

==Technacy guidelines==
The [[Australia]]n Federal Government has [http://www.dest.gov.au/archive/science/astec/future/final/futureb.html set a target] for this capability across all K-12 and teacher [[education]]. It asserts that all technological activity always, whether it is immediately apparent or not, contains the following:

# '''task purpose and context factors''': normally difficult to control in the first instance and includes temporal (time based) and contingency factors;
# '''agent(s) of the task''': usually seen as human contribution of knowledge, technique, organisation, skill, process, values, etc. The agent is normally, but not exclusively, the human contribution (sometimes labelled 'Human Factors' or simply &quot;People&quot;);
# '''at least one physical or abstract 'tool' being used''': either devices/instruments or 'manipulators' such as algorithms or systems;
# '''at least one resource material or data being manipulated by the above tool''': includes such things as materials drawn from the eco-environment, data, or objects shaped by the 'tools'.

However, the notion of technacy neither implies good or bad design, but rather, models the essential elements inherent in all technological activity; at any scale of complexity, or at any time historically. It therefore suggests that good or bad design can be explained through analysis of the four technacy elements and the interactions of those elements. It offers a basic framework for tasks that may include:

* planning what to address in technological research, 
* educational experiences, 
* evaluating situations from a technological perspective or, 
* creating innovative solutions in new contexts or purposes or by way of mixing [[Technological Genre]].


===Propositions===
# '''Critical Technacy''', is the deep, methodical and rational examination of technology as a phenomenon.
# All technological activity integrates the above four elements as a minimum system. Thus, no technological activity is possible with less than the four elements being engaged as a minimum system.
# All technology choices are value laden and context dependent, and as such, technology transfer problems can occur when a solution intended for one context and purpose is not appropriate for a different context and purpose
# '''Validation of technological knowledge''' progresses by way of '''Context Criteria''' and '''Purpose Achievement''': adhoc, ''&quot;I know because it works, against the defined context criteria&quot;''
# Given that technological knowledge integrates the agent (people), the tools and the eco-resource, towards a purpose with contextual criteria to meet, technological actions necessarily inherit ethical/moral criteria.  Technacy necessitates ethical, moral &amp; affect considerations, even if blithely ignored.
# The context and purpose criteria basis of validating if something 'works',  implies that Deep Technological Expertise, in any Genre, is driven by experience in optimising the scope of context criteria measures to be used for the scale of the purpose set.  Under-estimating or over-estimating the scope of context criteria to be used may invalidate the claim ''&quot;I know because it works&quot;''. 
# The above four elements of technacy interact in a deliberate logical way, and not in an arbitrary or disassociated way.
# The above four elements are paradoxically both resource and constraints to the functionality of the system
# The four minimum elements form the basis of  [[Technological Genre]]: eg, the Genre of Textiles technology contains typical and specific tools, materials, and human factors for a purpose and context, that is different from the genre of information technology.
# All events and things can be viewed from a technological perspective, by studying the four elements and their interactions, as a minimum system. However, a technological (technacy) perspective may not be the optimum framework for understanding every event or item under study. Use the technacy perspective appropriately, normally, for understanding the possible technological aspect of any event or item to be studied.
# Innovations often merge different  [[Technological Genre]].
# The four elements of the technacy theory form a [[fractal]] system where any one of them can be a product of another technacy system, and where the product of any technacy system can be an element of a new technacy system.  This simple repeating pattern is a 'model' for explaining both the basic underlining structure of technological activity, and also its complexity and seemingly unlimited scope of manifestations.
# Complex connected technological systems, whether digital like the internet, or industrial like human settlements, tend to form [[Scale-free_network]] characteristics.
# All technologies and technological systems tend to display inherent logical functionality. A great deal of these logical functions are based on the physical sciences and are usually the result of design.

==Australian origin==
Technology transfer into remote Australian, largely traditional, Indigenous communities has raised serious concerns about the way mainstream discourse perceives technologies as values neutral and not context specific.  A national Indigenous Technology research agency created the concept in 1986 to help communicate the understanding that all technologies are based on a fundamental system of interdependent factors. Understanding this system, or technacy, is to know technologies wholly, and as such, offers engineers, designers and policy makers a more robust framework for transference of technologies across cultures or into other contexts.

The '''Collingridge dilemma''' is a methodological quandary in which efforts to control [[technology development]] face a double-bind problem:
* an information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.  
* a [[Power (philosophy)|power]] problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.
The idea was coined by David Collingridge, The [[University of Aston]], Technology Policy Unit, in his 1980 book ''The Social Control of Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Control of Technology'' (New York: St. Martin's Press; London: Pinter) ISBN 031273168x

[[Image:HUARLogo.jpg|thumb]]
'''Humans United Against Robots''' (often abbreviated as '''HUAR''') is a semi-tongue-in-cheek organization designed to unify the human race and prepare them for a futuristic [[Technophobia#Technophobia in arts|robotic uprising]].  HUAR was created by [[Keith Malley]] of the popular [[Keith and The Girl]] [[podcast]].

==Mission statement==
{{cquote|HUAR – Humans United Against Robots – was designed to educate and awaken the citizenry of the world to the impending attack that computers and robots will put into effect against humans. HUAR is the collection of human beings that spread the word of this impending doom as well as doing what they can to help minimize the threat. Between computer programs that can identify human speech and match that up with their computerized dictionaries in order to understand our weaknesses to jokester scientists building robots specifically made to breathe fire from their mouths and shoot lasers from their eyes, it is evident that a task force had to be formed of members that take being at the top of the food chain seriously.

Robots will uprise. HUAR will be there.|30px|30px}}

==Phases==
Members of the organization claim that in order to prevent the impending robotic tyranny, a number of stages must be followed.

===Stage 1 - Awareness===
&quot;Awareness&quot; was the initial stage of defence announced in the summer of 2005. The main two components were informing the general public of the threat of robots, and performing surveillance on mechanics and scientists who may assist robots in their mission.  In pursuit of these goals, the following steps were taken:
*On November 28 2005, Keith interviewed [[Daniel H. Wilson|Daniel Wilson]], author of the book ''[[How to Survive a Robot Uprising]]''.
*The &quot;HUAR! Command Center&quot; forum was opened to catalogue ways our technologies might soon overthrow their organic creators.

===Stage 2 - Preparation===
&quot;Preparation&quot; was officially announced on 11 May 2007. Skills required for this stage are:
*Know where the screws are in all major electronics.
*General knowledge of how robots work is not required; just how to take them apart.
Further, the following must be at the ready at all times:
*A [[Henry F. Phillips|Phillips-head]] and flat-head screwdriver must always be carried.
*A [[super soaker]] filled with window cleaner solution.

Addendum:

On Wednesday May 30th, 2007 Brandon, a Senior Engineering Specialist recommended (and Keith has approved) the inclusion of the following items in the HUAR preparedness kit:

*Slotted &amp; Philips Terminal (small) Screwdriver
*Wire Cutter (6 in side cut pliers, or ‘dike’ is recommended)
*Voltmeter

'''LifeChips''' is the study and development of micro- and nano-scale technologies, systems and devices that combines methods developed by life scientists and technologists to help solve fundamental problems in the life sciences and in engineering. As the name suggests, it also represents the merging of two major industries, the microelectronic chip industry with the life science industry.

LifeChips has emerged from a growing research paradigm that combines technology development with the study of life science and medicine at microscopic and smaller size scales. Since the 1990s, governments and industries in the United States, Asia and Europe have initiated major efforts to bring [[microtechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]] to biology and medicine under such labels as &quot;[[bioMEMS]]&quot;, &quot;[[nanomedicine]]&quot; and &quot;[[nanobiotechnology|nano-bio]]&quot;. Other initiatives seek to use life-based materials for non-biological applications, such as the use of [[Unconventional computing|DNA for transistors]]. Additionally, high throughput biology products that utilize semiconductor chip technologies, such as [[lab-on-a-chip]], [[DNA microarray]]s and [[protein microarray]]s, have seen considerable commercial success. These events have driven the need for collaborations among researchers from traditionally different backgrounds and cultures, namely life scientists (biologists, medical researchers) and technologists (physical scientists, engineers). The LifeChips theme encompasses these research topics, as well as the interdisciplinary collaborative efforts themselves.

In the summer of 2006, the [http://www.nsf.gov National Science Foundation] awarded UC Irvine $2.9 million to teach LifeChips to graduate students. The award was part of the NSF's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program ([http://www.igert.org/ IGERT]) that supports interdisciplinary education for doctoral students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''behavior-shaping constraint''', also sometimes referred to as a forcing function, or [[poka-yoke]], is a technique used in [[error-tolerant design]] to prevent the user from making common [[error]]s or mistakes.  One example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving [[automobile]].  Another example from [[interaction design]], although not strictly a forcing function, is how software programs usually give a visual indication of what selection has been made by highlighting it with [[reverse video]] to aid in preventing [[description error]]s, where an intended action is performed on an object that isn't the one intended.

'''[[Industry]]''' is the overall application of technology and other resources to the generation of economic output by producing goods and services.  An '''industry''' is any grouping of [[business]]es that share a common method of generating [[profit (economics)|profit]]s, such as the &quot;construction industry&quot;.  The term is also often used to refer to [[heavy industry]].

'''[[Military science]]''' is the study of the [[wikt:technique|technique]], [[psychology]], practice and other phenomena which constitute [[war]] and armed [[conflict]]. It strives to be a scientific system that if properly employed, will greatly enhance the practitioner's ability to prevail in an armed conflict with any adversary. To this end, it is unconcerned whether that adversary is an opposing military force, guerrillas or other irregulars, or any adversary who knows of or utilizes military science in response.

{{portalpar|Telecommunication}}

'''[[Telecommunication]]''' is the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[signal (electronics)|signals]] over a distance for the purpose of [[communication]]. In modern times, this process almost always involves the use of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] by transmitters and receivers, but in earlier years it also involved the use of [[drum (communication)|drum]]s and visual signals such as [[smoke signal|smoke]], [[Hydraulic_telegraph#Greek_hydraulic_semaphore_system|fire]], [[beacon]]s, [[semaphore line]]s and other optical communications. 

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to telecommunication:

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''International Society for Technology in Education''' (ISTE) is a nonprofit professional organization with a worldwide membership of leaders and potential leaders in [[educational technology]]. It is dedicated to providing leadership and service to improve teaching and learning by advancing the effective use of technology in K–12 education and teacher education. 

==Purpose==
Home of the National Educational Technology Standards (NETS), the [[Center for Applied Research in Education Technology]] (CARET), and the [[National Educational Computing Conference]] (NECC), ISTE meets its mission through knowledge generation, professional development, and advocacy. ISTE also represents and informs its membership regarding educational issues of national scope through ISTE–DC. ISTE supports a worldwide network of Affiliates and Special Interest Groups (SIGs). 

ISTE has provided leadership in providing standards for Administrators, Teachers and Students for more than 10 years.  ISTE released the [http://cnets.iste.org/students/s_stands.html NETS•S] refreshed at the NECC 2007 conference in Atlanta, GA.  These refreshed standards provide the framework for technology standards for students. The [http://www.iste.org/Content/NavigationMenu/NETS/ForTeachers/2008Standards/NETS_T_Standards_Final.pdf NETS•T] were updated and released at the 2008 NECC in San Antonio, Texas. NETS•A (for Administrators) is in the process of being refreshed.

ISTE also has affiliates worldwide from local, provincial, state and national bodies.

==Publications and other Resources==
In addition to publishing [[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS), ISTE publishes [http://www.iste.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Publications/LL/L_L.htm &quot;Learning and Leading&quot;] magazine, a wide assortment of books and classroom materials.  They also offer podcasts, professional development and have purchased an &quot;island&quot; on the virtual world called  [[Second Life]]. 


In 2009 ISTE launched its [http://www.isteconnects.org official blog] with the intention of connecting members of the greater educational technology community with one another. ISTEConnects utilizes many web 2.0 tools to connect the educational technology community together, such as hosting an editable Google spreadsheet that allows users to add themselves to a [http://www.isteconnects.org/2009/03/13/calling-all-twitter-users-going-to-necc-2009/ Twitter Roll Call] and list the URL for their personal blogs. On February 13, 2009  ISTEConnects permanently  opened the blog up to the entire educational technology community by inviting anyone to [http://www.isteconnects.org/2009/03/05/get-your-voice-published-on-isteconnects/ create their own blog posts] to be published on ISTEConnects. Blog updates are available via an [http://www.isteconnects.org/widget/ embed-able widget] that is constantly updated when a new blog posts is published or when ISTEConnects sends out a tweet. ISTEConnects can be followed on Twitter [http://twitter.com/isteconnects @isteconnects] and the most current conversation can be found by searching for the hashtag [http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23NECC09 #NECC09].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''ram press''' is a device or machine commonly used to press items with a mechanical ram, such as with a [[plunger]], [[piston]], [[force pump]], or [[hydraulic ram]]. In food preparation, there are various kinds of ram presses:

The ''fruit ram press'' and ''[[cider]] ram press'' are both types of [[fruit press]]es that extract the juices out of the fruit through pressure. The second makes [[apple cider]].

An ''[[oil seed]] ram press'' is also known as a ''[[Vegetable fats and oils|oil]] ram press''  and it extracts the oil out of oil seeds.

'''Experiments in Art and Technology''' (E.A.T.) was a non-profit and tax-exempt organization established to develop collaborations between artists and engineers. The group operated by facilitating person-to-person contacts between [[artist]]s and [[engineer]]s, rather than defining a formal process for cooperation. '''E.A.T.''' initiated and carried out projects that expanded the role of the artist in contemporary society and helped eliminate the separation of the individual from technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] (2003). ''[[Digital Art]]'' (World of Art series). London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

It was officially launched in 1967 by the engineers [[Billy Klüver]] and [[Fred Waldhauer]] and the artists [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Robert Whitman]]. These men had previously collaborated, most notably in 1966 when they together organized '''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering''', a series of [[performance art]] presentations that united artists and engineers. The performances were held in [[New York City]]'s [[69th Regiment Armory]], on [[Lexington Avenue]] between 25th and 26th Streets as an homage to the original and historical 1913 [[Armory show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1734]''Vehicle,'' online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=396] documents, history online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Such collaborations continued to break down barriers between the arts and scientists in the 60’s, 70’s, and 80’s, and indirectly launched and supported the experimental sound artist [[John Cage]], dancer [[Merce Cunningham]], and pop artist [[Andy Warhol]].

The pinnacle of E.A.T. activity is generally considered to be the Pepsi Pavilion at Expo '70 at [[Osaka]] [[Japan]] where E.A.T. artists and engineers collaborated to design and program an immersive [[dome]].

Twenty-eight regional E.A.T. chapters were established throughout the U.S. in the late 1960s to promote collaborations between artists and engineers and expand the artist’s role in social developments related to new technologies. In 2002 the [[University of Washington]] hosted a reunion to celebrate the history of these regional liaisons and consider the legacy of E.A.T. for artists working with new technologies in the twenty-first century.

In 1966, 10 New York artists worked with 30 engineers and scientists from the world renowned Bell Telephone Laboratories to create groundbreaking performances that incorporated new technology. Video projection, wireless sound transmission, and Doppler sonar had never been seen in the art of the 60's. The 9 Evenings DVD Series is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies. These performances still resonate today, as forerunners of the close and rapidly-evolving relationship between artists and technology. The dense and daunting exhibition represented an experiment in the archaeology of the avant-garde. The installation gathers the vast and insightful but also often undecipherable shards, artifacts, apparatus, photographs, drawings, diagrams, correspondence, and documentary film footage that provides information, but little if any comprehensive understanding of a series of ten individual works that, although wildly uneven on every level from aesthetic to technical, have entered the canon of performance art, experimental music and theater, bridging the gap from the eras of Dada, Fluxus and the Happenings/Actions of the 1960s, through the current generation of arts for whom multimedia and technology are the norm. 

==Documentation==
In 1972 [[Billy Klüver]], [[Barbara Rose]] and Julie Martin edited the book &quot;Pavilion&quot;, that documented the design and construction of the E.A.T. Pepsi Pavilion for [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].

In 2001 [[Billy Klüver]]  produced an exhibition of photo and text panels entitled &quot;The Story of E.A.T.: Experiments in Art and Technology, 1960 - 2001 by Billy Klüver.&quot;  It was first shown in [[Rome]] and then again at [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in 2002. The exhibition went to [[Lafayette College]] in the spring 2002, then to the Evolution Festival in Leeds, England, and University of Washington, in Seattle. In 2003 it traveled to [[San Diego State University]] in San Diego, California and then to a gallery in Santa Maria, California run by Ardison Phillips - who was the artist who managed the Pepsi Pavilion in 1970. From April to June 2003 a Japanese version was shown at a large exhibition at the NTT Intercommunication Center (ICC) in [[Tokyo]] which also included a number of object/artifacts and documents and  E.A.T. posters, as well as works of art that Klüver and E.A.T. were involved in. A similar showing took place in Norrköping Museum of Art, [[Norrköping]], Sweden in September 2004 and a small version of the panels were presented in 2008 at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] as part of a celebration of Experiments in Art and Technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Global Data Synchronisation Network''' (GDSN) is an [[internet]]-based, interconnected network of interoperable data pools and a global registry known as the [[GS1]] Global Registry, that enables companies around the globe to exchange standardised and synchronised [[supply chain]] data with their trading partners using a standardised [[Global Product Classification]].

GDSN assures that data exchanged between trading partners is accurate and compliant with universally supported standards.

GDSN consists of supplier/retailer trading partner, data pools that hold and process trading partner data and the GS1 Global Registry, a directory that helps locate data sources and keep relationships between trading partners in sync.

==Global identification numbers==
The [[Global Location Number]] (GLN) and the [[Global Trade Item Number]] (GTIN) are the global identification numbers in the GDSN. The GLN is the identifier for [[Legal entity|legal entities]], trading partners and locations while the GTIN is the identifiers for trade items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epcglobalinc.org/about/media_centre/EPCglobal_and_GDSN_v4_0_Final.pdf EPCglobal: The EPCgloabal Network and the The Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ingress cancellation''' is a nifty advanced [[PHY]] technology that digitally removes in-channel ingress. It won't do anything about out-of-channel ingress, but if a carrier pops up in the middle of the upstream data signal, ingress cancellation can remove the interfering carrier without causing packet loss. In fact, ingress cancellation works its magic such that it can remove one or more carriers that are higher in amplitude than the data signal! Ingress cancellation eventually will break if the in-channel ingress gets too high.

'''Integrated Technology Processes''' (ITP) include all the requirements, know-how, means necessary for the design office, manufacturing, quality control to define and produce an elementary part or an assembly within a known supply chain.

== Technology Processes are end-to-end processes ==

'''Technology Processes''' (i.e. “Techno Processes”) are end-to-end processes aligned with a specific manufacturing or assembly technology.

E.g. Techno Processes are used for technologies such as :
&lt;li&gt; Tubing,
&lt;li&gt; Sheet Metal,
&lt;li&gt; Mechanical Parts,
&lt;li&gt; Jigs and Tools,
&lt;li&gt; Composites,
&lt;li&gt; Electricity,
&lt;li&gt; Thermoplastics,
&lt;li&gt; Assembly…&lt;/li&gt;

The &quot;end-to-end&quot; appellation means Techno Processes address all the activities from design to manufacture and assemble of an elementary part or an assembly.

Several Techno Processes are most of the time required to build a final product.

== Integration of Technology Processes improves efficiency ==

'''Integrated Technology Processes''' are used in the aerospace industry to improve efficiency during conception and development phases, by enhancing process automation, information concurrency and avoiding data '''recopy'''.

&lt;br /&gt;Concurrent engineering is considered as an accelerator of efficiency and quality on the whole development process. 
Beside the concurrent use of the geometrical models (DMU), the Integration of Techno Processes is necessary.

Integration of Techno Processes (i.e. &quot;Integrated Techno Processes&quot;) corresponds to the optimization of all the requirements (processes), know-how (skill rules, methods), means (organization, IS tools) necessary for the design office, manufacturing and quality control.

A '''hypercommunicator''' is a highly engaged communicator who uses traditional and [[electronic media]] platforms with [[high frequency]] to socially engage individuals and [[Virtual community|virtual communities]]. They may or may not be involved in traditional communications fields such as [[public relations]], journalism, or advertising.

Hypercommunicators are [[bleeding edge]] adopters of new communications tools, technologies and products to increasingly share their personal and professional lives, observations, news, and information. Hypercommunicators simultaneously make use of multiple [[e-mail address]]es and tools, chat, [[instant messaging]], [[Social network service|online social networking]] sites, publish their own Web sites and blogs, as well as create other content including video, audio, photos and graphics, and text for public consumption.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Intelligent Environments''' (IE) are spaces with [[embedded systems]] and [[information and communication technologies]] creating interactive spaces that bring computation into the physical world. &quot;Intelligent environments are spaces in which computation is seamlessly used to enhance ordinary activity. One of the driving forces behind the emerging interest in highly interactive environments is to make computers not only genuine user-friendly but also essentially invisible to the user&quot; (Steventon and Wright 2006). 

IEs describe physical environments in which information and communication technologies and sensor systems disappear as they become embedded into physical objects, infrastructures, and the surroundings in which we live, travel, and work. The goal here is to allow computers to take part in activities never previously involved and allow people to interact with computers via gesture, voice, movement, and context. The annual IET conferences on Intelligent Environments (IE06; IE07) present current trends and applications.   

== Technology ==
As the Intelligent Environments Conference (2007) points out: 'Types of Intelligent Environments range from private to public and from fixed to mobile; some are ephemeral while others are permanent; some change type during their life span. The realisation of Intelligent Environments requires the convergence of different prominent disciplines: Information and Computer Science, Architecture, Material Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Sociology and Design. In addition, technical breakthroughs are required in key enabling technology fields, such as, microelectronics (e.g., miniaturisation, power consumption), communication and networking technologies (e.g., broadband and wireless networks), smart materials (e.g., bio-implants) and intelligent agents (e.g., context awareness and ontologies)'.

An example of such spaces is the 'Intelligent Room'; a laboratory room which supports [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], and movement tracking, based on about fifty distinct intercommunication software agents that run on interconnected computers (Cohen 1997). Another is [[Intelligent cities]], territories that sustain innovation processes with virtual spaces and ICTs (Komninos 2002). An extremely rich source of applications and experimentations in the field is to be found in the [[Intelligent Community Forum]] (2007) and the cities selected by ICF as top intelligent communities.

The critical question is not whether we may build intelligent environments, but how we may use these environments as instruments for distributed problem-solving (Bowen-James 1997; Novak 1997).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Strategic Service Management''', SSM, is a business strategy that optimizes a company's provided services through the effort of synchronizing: service parts and resources forecasting, service partners, workforce technicians, and service pricing.

== Benefits of Strategic Service Management&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ==

*Revenue opportunity through the servicing of manufactured products experiencing decreased sales
*Leveraged [[customer loyalty]] through increased post-sale service performance
**Faster resolution time for customer support service calls
*Heightened asset accountability and tracking
*Increased worker productivity
*More knowledgeable workers to prevent common mistakes

== Best practices&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==

*Bring [[field service management]] and parts logistics under one operational umbrella
*Address process deficiencies, clearly defining required improvements and success criteria, before evaluating technology solutions
*Leverage partnerships with service and logistics providers
*Prioritize [[aftermarket]] service as a top-line business opportunity
*Involve stakeholders early and often in transformational process
*Adopt a two-pronged approach to measure the efficacy of after-market services: operational and strategic
*Ensure SSM strategy is integrated enterprise-wide
*Shift focus towards [[forecasting]] and planning: technician capacity and work order demand

== Results from Strategic Service Management deployments&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ==
 
* [[Avaya]] reduced Service parts inventory from $250 million to $160 million
* [[Sun Microsystems]] saved $40 million in the first year
* [[Dell]] grew service revenues over 20% in one year

{{COI|date=September 2009}}
'''Evergreening''' refers to a variety of legal and business strategies by which technology producers with patents over products that are about to expire, retain rent from them by either taking out new [[patents]] (for example over associated delivery systems, or new pharmaceutical mixtures) or by buying out or frustrating competitors, for longer periods of time than would normally be permissible under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/06/1091732084185.html|title=Faunce TA The awful truth about evergreening|date=2005-12-20|accessdate=2007-09-21|publisher= [[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Evergreening' is not a formal concept of patent law. It is best understood as a social idea used to refer to the myriad ways in which pharmaceutical patent owners utilise the law and related regulatory processes to extend their high rent-earning [[intellectual property rights]] otherwise known as [[intellectual monopoly privileges]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin G, Sorenson C and Faunce T. Balancing intellectual monopoly privileges and the need for essential medicines. Globalization and Health 2007, 3:4 doi:10.1186/1744-8603-3-4&lt;/ref&gt; particularly over highly profitable (either in total sales volume or price per unit) 'blockbuster' drugs. Thus, while the courts are an instrument frequently used by [[pharmaceutical]] brand name manufacturers to prolong their patent royalties, 'evergreening' is rarely mentioned explicitly by judges in patent
protection cases. The term usually refers to threats made to competitors about a brand-name
manufacturer's tactical use of pharmaceutical patents (including over uses, delivery systems and even packaging), not to extension of any particular patent over an active product ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Lexchin J. 'Linkage' pharmaceutical evergreening in Canada and Australia Australia and New Zealand Health Policy 2007, 4:8 doi:10.1186/1743-8462-4-8 http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Art%20ANZHP%20Linkage%20Evergreening.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy About Evergreening ==

The Evergreening process has caused some controversy in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. In this context, evergreening may be used by manufacturers of a particular drug to restrict or prevent competition from manufacturers of [[Generic drug|generic equivalents to that drug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egagenerics.com/gen-evergrn.htm|title=Evergreening of Pharmaceutical Market Protection|accessdate=2007-10-19|publisher= European Generic Medicines Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, an extensive and lengthy inquiry by the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), found that the Hatch-Waxman legislation or [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]] (which was instrumental in establishing the US generic pharmaceuticals industry) had resulted in as many as 75% of new drug applications by generic drug manufacturers experiencing legal actions under patent laws by the original
brand name patent owner. These were driving up US drug costs by keeping the cheaper generic versions off the market. The FTC recommended that only one 'evergreening' injunction against a potential generic market entrant be permitted per product and an expedited process of resolving such claims.&lt;ref&gt;Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC
Study. Federal Trade Commission 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linkage Evergreening and International Trade Law==

The process of evergreening may involve specific aspects of [[patent law]] and [[international trade law]]. Linkage evergreening refers to the process whereby pharmaceutical safety, quality and efficacy regulators are required to 'link' their normal evaluation with an assessment of whether an impending generic product may breach an existing patent. In 1993, under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]
(NAFTA)-induced Canadian Notice Of Compliance (NOC) regulations, drug safety, quality and efficacy regulators at [[Health Canada]] were prevented from issuing an authorization for market entry, until the all of the relevant patents on a brand name product had been proven to have expired. As a result, when a Canadian generic company(such as [[Apotex]]) submits its application to get a product approved, it also sends a Notice of Allegation (NOA) to the patent holder claiming that no patents are being infringed. The patent holder then has 45 days in which to initiate an application in the [[Federal Court of Canada]], seeking an order to prohibit the relevant Minister from issuing a Notice of Compliance to the generic manufacturer for a period of 24 months, or upon resolution of the court application, whichever is sooner. The problems with this were analysed in the [[Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada]] or [[Romanov Report]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzhealthpolicy.com/content/4/1/8|title=Faunce TA and Lexchin J. 'Linkage' pharmaceutical evergreening in Canada and Australia|date=01-06-2007|accessdate=2007-10-19|publisher= Australia and New Zealand Health Policy 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Australia's legislatively fulfilling the article 17.10.4 linkage obligation was a requirement of entry into force of the [[AUSFTA]], and Australia had to enact consequent amendments to the ''Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth).'' The amendments inserted a new section 26B which required applicants for marketing approval to certify that their
product would not infringe a valid patent claim, or that the patent holder has been notified of the application. In response the Australian government passed anti-evergreening amendments in Sections 26C and 26D of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) designed to prevent patent holders from manipulating the court system to lengthen the term of the patent and delay the entry of generic pharmaceuticals into the market. They are a strong statement of Australia's 'legitimate expectations' of benefit (that is of freedom from pharmaceutical price rises due to 'evergreening') in this area. The Chief Australian negotiator of this aspect of the AUSFTA stated &lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;We are not importing the Hatch-Waxman legislation into Australian law as a result of the free trade agreement...[Article 17.10.4] will not extend the time of the marketing approval process, and it does not add or provide any additional rights to the patent holders in that process...there is no injunction that can be applied under this article...it will be clear in the legislation tomorrow....we are establishing a measure in the marketing approval process that will fully meet the commitments under this article''.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Deady S, Special Negotiator, Office of Trade Negotiations, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Commonwealth of Australia: Evidence to Senate Select Committee on the FTA Between Australia and the USA, Parliament of Australia, Canberra.Monday 21 June 2004: 31, 33, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The US, nevertheless, has expressly signalled their disapproval of Australia's implementation of article 17.10.4 in an exchange of letters between the Australian Minister for Trade and the [[US Trade Representative]] on the implementation of the AUSFTA, in which the USTR stated: &lt;br /&gt;
''&quot;If Australia's law is not sufficient to prevent the marketing of a product, or a product for an approved use, where the produce or use is covered by a patent, Australia will have acted inconsistently with the Agreement. We will be monitoring the matter closely, and reserve all rights and remedies as discussed below. We also remain concerned about recent amendments to sections 26B(1)(a), 26C and 26D of the ''Therapeutic Goods Act of 1989''. Under these amendments, pharmaceutical patents owners risk incurring significant penalties when they seek to enforce their patent rights. These provisions impose a potentially significant, unjustifiable, and discrimintory burden on the enjoyment of patent rights, specifically on owners of pharmaceutical patents. I urge the Australian Government to review this matter, particularly in light of Australia's international legal obligations. The United States reserves its rights to challenge the consistency of these amendments with such obligations.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Letter From Robert Zoellick, USTR, to Mark Vaile, Australian
Minister for Trade 17 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
The capacity of the US to make such threats is arguably facilitated by the linkage of article 17.10.4 of the AUSFTA to a [[Non-violation nullification of benefits]] provision. The US has achieved a similar provision to article 17.10.4 of the AUSFTA in article 18.9.4 of the [[Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (KORUSFTA).&lt;ref&gt;Office of the US Trade Representative: Proposed text: US-Korea Free Trade Agreement. [http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Agreements/Bilateral/Republic_of_Korea_FTA/Draft_Text/Section_Index.html]. accessed 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Such provisions are sometimes referred to as TRIPS-plus meaning that they are in addition to the patent requirements of the [[World Trade Organisation]] multilateral [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Roffe P. Bilateral agreements and a TRIPS-plus world: the Chile-USA Free Trade Agreement.Quakers United Nations Office Geneva, 2004, 56 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics prefer to refer to them as TRIPS-minus due to their potential, but controversial and still largely unproven, deleterious impact on public health.&lt;ref&gt;El-Said M. The Road from TRIPS-Minus, to TRIPS, to TRIPS-Plus
Implications of IPRs for the Arab World The Journal of World Intellectual Property 2005; 8 (1): 53-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Vines T, Gibbons H. New Forms of Evergreening in Australia: Misleading Advertising, Enantiomers and Data Exclusivity (2008) 16 Journal of Law and Medicine 220-232. http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-JLM%20evergreeningapotex09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation against evergreening ==
The main arguments in favor of governments regulating against evergreening are that rapid entry of multiple generic competitors after [[patent]] expiry is likely to lower prices and facilitate competition, and that eventual loss of monopoly was part of the trade-off for the initial award of patent (or [[intellectual monopoly privilege]]) protection in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Vines T, Gibbons H. New Forms of Evergreening in Australia: Misleading Advertising, Enantiomers and Data Exclusivity (2008) 16 Journal of Law and Medicine 220-232. http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-JLM%20evergreeningapotex09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison under [[Health Canada]] has become an important regulatory mechanism for policing 'linkage' evergreening. No attempt has been made to create a similar multidisciplinary regulatory agency in Australia. Yet, it appears that article 18.9.4 of the [[Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (KORUSFTA) has been specifically drafted to permit the establishment of such a pharmaceutical patent 'anti-evergreening' oversight agency.

The Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison is located in the Therapeutic Products
Directorate, Health Products and Foods Branch, [[Health Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. Therapeutic Products Directory. Drugs and Patents. http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/applic-demande/docs/patmedbrev/index-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Notice of Compliance Regulations it administers require the Minister of Health to maintain a Patent Register.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada Electronic copy of the Patent Register. http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/patregbrev/index-eng.php. (accessed 19 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This consists of patent lists submitted in respect of eligible NOC-issued drugs. The Minister responsible for Health Canada may refuse to add, or may delete, information from this Patent Register. Each patent list is audited (for example as to whether potential inclusions are mere 'evergreening' attempts) by the Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison. Reports produced by that body outline statistics relating to the maintenance of the Patent Register, including the number of patents filed, the number of patents accepted and rejected, and litigation resulting from the acceptance or rejection of patents for listing on the Patent Register. In October 2006, the Canadian federal government recognized that some brand-name companies had been abusing the NOC Regulations. It limited their use of 'evergreening' follow-on patents by promulgating regulations that prevented any new patents they filed after a generic company had submitted an application for approval of its product from being considered in the NOC Regulations process. Moreover the new regulations made it clear that patents covering areas without direct therapeutic application, such as processes or intermediates, could not be used to delay generic approval.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada. Canada Gazette Part II Regulations amending the patented medicines (notice of compliance) regulations 2006,140(21):1503-1525.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, anti-evergreening amendments to the ''Therapeutic Goods Act 1983 (Cth)''were part of the package of legislation required to be passed by the Australian Government as a precondition to entry into force of the [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]] (AUSFTA). They provide that where a certificate has been given under s26B by a generic manufacturer and the patent holder wishes to claim a [[patent]] and institute infringement proceedings, he or she must first certify that the proceedings are being commenced in good faith, have reasonable prospects of success (as defined in s26C(4)) and will be  conducted without unreasonable delay. If the certificate is found to be false or midleading, fines of up to $10 million apply and the Cth Attorney General is permitted to join the action to recoup losses to the PBS. Section 26D provides that a patent holder who seek an [[interlocutory injunction]] to prevent the marketing of the generic pharmaceutical must obtain leave from the government to do.&lt;ref&gt;Therapeutic Goods Act 1983 (Cth) ss 26C and 26D&lt;/ref&gt;

== Are Regulations Against Evergreening Contrary to TRIPs? ==
Both the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Associations ([[IFPMA]]) and the US [[PhRMA]] have stated that the Australian anti-evergreening provisions are inconsistent with obligations under the [[World Trade Organisation]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] TRIPs article 27 which prohibits discrimination in an area of technology (in this case pharmaceuticals).&lt;ref&gt;International pharma crits FTA Pharma in Focus [http://www.pharmainfocus.com.au/news.asp?newsid=469]. 25 October
2004, accessed 12 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that the Australian anti-'linkage evergreening' legislation affects only pharmaceutical patents and is therefore discriminatory under TRIPs.

Australia, on the other hand, is likely to argue that [[international trade law]] recognises that where a unique problem arises specifically referable only to a particular field of technology, a solution applying ''sui generis'' only to that field of technology cannot be said to be discriminatory according to the ordinary meaning and purpose of the TRIPs agreement or the AUSFTA as required by article AUSFTA 21.9.2 (incorporating articles 31 and 32 of the ''Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties'' (VCLT). The decision of the [[World Trade Organisation]] Dispute Resolution panel in ''Canada – Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products case'', for example, accepted that  it was not inconsistent with TRIPs to provide for distinct patent rules that responded to practical consequences of differences between fields of technology.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Canada – Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products'' WTO Doc WT/DS114/R 2000:5.9. Report of the Panel&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all nations including the United States now have anti-evergreening legislation as part of their public health policy and none of this legislation (which is clearly targeted at a problem particular to the pharmaceutical industry) has been argued to be contrary to TRIPs. Further, there are a number of obligations imposed by the AUSFTA that relate to the enjoyment of patent rights for pharmaceuticals alone, including extension of the terms of a pharmaceutical patent to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process(17.9.8(b)). This is clearly not discriminatory because the issue of delays in enjoyment of patent rights due to the marketing approval process arises only in the context of pharmaceutical patents. 

== Future of Evergreening: Supragenerics, Nanogenerics, Data Exclusivity, Pharmacogenomics ==

In terms of future evergreening strategies pharmaceutical [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued that patent holders May 1) seek to make incremental patentable innovations to existing products with soon-to-expire patents through the generic arm of their own company and launch early to secure market share(supragenerics), 2) attempt to make separately patentable [[nanotechnology]] or biologic versions of such pharmaceuticals through the generic arm of their own company and launch early to secure market share, 3) seek to exclude generic companies from the safety, quality and efficacy data they need to prepare for springboarding (early market launch after patent expiry) using TRIPs-plus data exclusivity protections and 4) seek to obtain an additional [[intellectual property right]] (intellectual monopoly privilege) for soon-to-patent-expire-pharmaceutical by patenting it along with a genetic test (to establish either or both of potential toxicity or efficacy)([[pharmacogenomics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Challenges for Australia's Bio/Nanopharma Policies: trade deals, public goods and reference pricing in sustainable industrial renewal Australia and New Zealand Health Policy 2007, 4:9 doi:10.1186/1743-8462-4-9 http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Art%20ANZHP%20BioNano.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Vines T, Gibbons H.

'''Moving parts''' are parts of a device that are in motion. This is different compared to static parts which are parts that are not in motion. Moving parts do not include any moving fluids, such as [[fuel]], [[coolant]] or [[hydraulic fluid]]. Moving parts also do not include any mechanical [[lock]]s, [[switch]]es, [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]] and [[Screw|bolts]], screw caps for bottles (the cap used to cover a [[water bottle]] when not in use) etc. 

Although static parts are at rest and do not move there is significant [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] action that takes place at the atomic level. The [[electron]]s at the atomic level are in a constant state of motion.

'''[[Military science]]''' is the study of the [[wikt:technique|technique]], [[psychology]], [[Practice (learning method)|practice]] and other phenomena which constitute [[war]] and armed [[conflict]]. It strives to be a scientific system that if properly employed, will greatly enhance the practitioner's ability to prevail in an armed conflict with any adversary. To this end, it is unconcerned whether that adversary is an opposing military force, guerrillas or other irregulars, or any adversary who knows of or utilizes military science in response.

'''Ecotechnology''' is an [[Applied science|applied science]] that seeks to fulfill human needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and subtly manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two complementary fields of study: the 'ecology of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring a substantial understanding of the structures and processes of ecosystems and societies. All [[Sustainable engineering|sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure an orientation of precaution in the implementation of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology. 

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Remedy|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be included in evaluation for effective remediation. From the point of view of the ecosystem, construction that is taken for human economic activities should strive to reduce impacts on nature as much as possible. To enhance the understanding of construction professionals about natural ecology, consultation about the environment with ecological experts during planning and construction is necessary. Thus, ecological experts who are familiar with the local environment play very important roles in ecotechnology teamwork. 

Sustainable development requires the implementation of appropriate environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by: 
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources, 
* control of impacts on ecosystems, 
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,  
* eco-marketing, 
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and 
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public. 
Mastering development and application of ecotechnology in industry and the services sector is therefore a key requirement. The quality of ecotechnological knowledge depends on the efficiency of the multidisciplinary synthesis of knowledge and skills in natural sciences and technologies, information and communication sciences, economics, legal and social sciences.

{{Renaissance}}

'''Renaissance technology''' is the set of European artifacts and customs which span the [[Renaissance]] period, roughly the 14th through the 16th century. The era is marked by profound technical advancements such as the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective in drawing]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore| double shell domes]] and [[Star fort|Bastion fortresses]].  Sketchbooks from artisans of the period ([[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for example) give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.

[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

== Basic technology ==
Some important Renaissance technologies, including both innovations and improvements on existing techniques:
*mining and metallurgy
*[[blast furnace]] enabled iron to be produced in significant quantities
*[[finery forge]] enabled pig iron (from the blast furnace) into bar iron ([[wrought iron]])
*[[slitting mill]] mechanized the production of iron rods for [[nail (engineering)|nailmaking]]
*[[smeltmill]] increased the output of lead over previous methods ([[bole hill]])

=== 15th century ===
'''[[Crankshaft|Crank and connecting rod]]'''
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006690 Mechanik ^ Wasserförderung ^ Pumpe.jpg|thumb|150px|Water-raising pump powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism ([[Georg Andreas Böckler]], 1661)]]

The [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] mechanism which converts circular into reciprocal motion is of utmost importance for the mechanization of work processes; it is first attested for [[Hierapolis sawmill|Roman water-powered sawmills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Renaissance, its use is greatly diversified and mechanically refined; now connecting-rods are also applied to double compound cranks, while the [[flywheel]] is employed to get these cranks over the 'dead-spot'.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 112&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of such machines appears, inter alia, in the works of the 15th century engineers [[Anonymous of the Hussite Wars]] and [[Taccola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, cranks and connecting rods become an integral part of machine design and are applied in ever more elaborate ways: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 depicts eighteen different applications, a number which rises in the 17th century ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas Böckler]] to 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Printing press]]'''
[[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|left|Two printers operating a Gutenberg-style [[printing press]] (1568). Such presses could make around 3.600 impressions per workday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolf 1974, 67f.&quot;/&gt;]]

The invention of the printing press by the German goldsmith [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (1398–1468) is widely regarded as the single most important event of the second millennium,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm People of the Millenium] for an overview of the wide acclaim. In 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their &quot;People of the Millennium&quot; countdown]. In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium]; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the defining moments of the Renaissance. The [[Printing Revolution]] which it sparks throughout Europe works as a modern &quot;agent of change&quot; ([[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]) in the transformation of medieval society. The mechanical device consists of a [[screw press]] modified for printing purposes which can produce 3.600 pages per workday,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolf 1974, 67f.&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=67f}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the mass production of printed books on a proto-industrial scale. By the start of the sixteenth century, printing presses are operating in over 200 cities in a dozen European countries, producing more than twenty million volumes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f&quot;&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): &quot;The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450-1800&quot;, London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: &quot;Comunidades Imaginadas. Reflexiones sobre el origen y la difusión del nacionalismo&quot;, Fondo de cultura económica, Mexico 1993, ISBN 978-968-16-3867-2, pp. 58f&lt;/ref&gt; By 1600 their output had risen tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies, while Gutenberg book printing [[global spread of the printing press|spread from Europe further afield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f&quot;/&gt; 

The relatively free flow of information transcends borders and induced a sharp rise in Renaissance literacy, learning and education; the circulation of (revolutionary) ideas among the rising middle classes, but also the peasants, threatens the traditional power monopoly of the ruling nobility and is a key factor in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The dawn of the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]], the era of mass communication, is instrumental in fostering the gradual [[democratization of knowledge]] which sees for the first time modern media phenomena such as the [[newspaper#history|press]] or [[bestseller]]s emerging.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prized [[incunable]]s, which are testimony to the aesthetic taste and high technical competence of Renaissance book printers, are one lasting legacy of the fifteenth century.

'''[[Parachute]]'''
[[File:Homo Volans.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fausto Veranzio|Veranzio]]'s 1595 parachute design titled &quot;Flying Man&quot;]]

The earliest known parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from 1470s [[Renaissance Italy]];&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Add. MSS 34,113, fol. 200v&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts a free-hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1968, 462f&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1968|pp=462f}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a safety measure, four straps run from the ends of the rods to a waist belt. Around 1485, a more advanced parachute was sketched by the polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (fol. 381v), which he scales in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1968, 462f&quot;/&gt; Leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame, altering the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1968, 465&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1968|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Venetian inventor [[Fausto Veranzio]] (1551–1617) modifies da Vinci's parachute sketch by keeping the square frame, but replacing the canopy with a bulging sail-like piece of cloth. This he realizes decelerates the fall more effectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1968, 465&quot;/&gt; In 1617, Veranzio successfully tests his parachute design by jumping from a tower in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Wilkins]] (1614 - 1672): ''Mathematical Magic of the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry, part I: Concerning Mechanical Powers Motion, part II, Deadloss or Mechanical Motions'', published in London in 1648&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]'''

The earliest recorded uses of the astrolabe for navigational purposes are by the Portuguese explorers [[Diogo de Azambuja]] (1481), [[Bartholomew Diaz]] (1487/88) and [[Vasco da Gama]] (1497/98) during their [[Portuguese discoveries|sea voyages around Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stimson|1985|p=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dry dock]]'''

While dry docks were already known in [[Hellenistic]] shipbuilding,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|pp=326−328}}&lt;/ref&gt; these facilities were reintroduced in 1495/96, when [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England ordered one to be built at the [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth navy base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarton|1946|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th century ===
'''[[Dry dock|Floating dock]]'''
[[File:Floating Dock. Woodcut included in the 'Descrittione' of Venice 1560.jpg|thumb|left|Floating dock at Venice (1560)]]

The earliest known description of a floating dock comes from a small Italian book printed in Venice in 1560, titled ''Descrittione dell'artifitiosa machina''. In the booklet, an unknown author asks for the privilege of using a new method for the salvaging of a grounded ship and then proceeds to describe and illustrate his approach. The included [[woodcut]] shows a ship flanked by two large floating trestles, forming a roof above the vessel. The ship is pulled in an upright position by a number of ropes attached to the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarton|1946|pp=153f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domenico Fontana, Lowering of Vatican Obelisk, Rome, 1586.jpg|thumb|Relocation of the Vatican Obelisk, Rome, by [[Domenico Fontana]] (1586)]]
'''[[Crane (machine)#History|Lifting tower]]'''

A lifting tower was used to great effect by [[Domenico Fontana]] to relocate the monolithic [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster 1999 428&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its weight of 361 t was far greater than any of the blocks the Romans are known to have lifted by cranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancaster 1999 428&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name group=&quot;A&quot;&gt;53.3 t at [[Trajan's Column]] ({{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=426}}); 60−100 t at the Jupiter temple of [[Baalbek]] ({{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=16}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 17th century ===
'''[[Newspaper]]'''
[[Image:Relation Aller Fuernemmen und gedenckwuerdigen Historien (1609).jpg|thumb|left|Title page of the ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'' (1609), the earliest newspaper&lt;ref&gt;World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html &quot;Newspapers: 400 Years Young!&quot;]; {{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The newspaper is an offspring of the printing press from which the [[newspaper|press]] derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th century sees a rising demand for up-to-date information which can not be covered effectively by the circulating [[Avviso|hand-written newssheets]]. For &quot;gaining time&quot; from the slow copying process, [[Johann Carolus]] of Strassburg is the first to publish his German-language ''Relation'' by using a printing press (1605).&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber 2006, 396f&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapid succession, further German newspapers are established in Wolfenbüttel (''[[Avisa Relation oder Zeitung]]''), Basel, Frankfurt and Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber 2006, 396f&quot;/&gt; From 1618 onwards, enterprising Dutch printers take up the practice and begin to provide the English and French market with translated news.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber 2006, 396f&quot;/&gt; By the mid-17th century it is estimated that political newspapers which enjoyed the widest popularity reach up to 250,000 readers in the Holy Roman Empire, around one fourth of the literate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools, devices, work processes ==
=== 15th century ===
'''[[Archimedes screw|Cranked Archimedes screw]]'''

The German engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] equips in his ''[[Bellifortis]]'' (1405) the Archimedes screw with a crank mechanism which soon replaces the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|pp=105, 111, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Reel|Cranked reel]]'''

In the textile industry, cranked [[reel]]s for winding skeins of yarn were introduced in the early 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 111&quot;/&gt; 

'''[[Brace (tool)|Brace]]'''

The earliest carpenter's braces equipped with a U-shaped grip, that is with a [[Crank (mechanism)|compound crank]], appears between 1420 and 1430 in [[Flandres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 112&quot;/&gt;

'''Cranked well-hoist'''

The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German ''Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Paddle wheel boat|Paddle wheel boat powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism]]'''

While paddle wheel boats powered by manually turned [[crankshaft]]s were already conceived of by earlier writers such as [[Guido da Vigevano]] and the [[Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|pp=80f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[Roberto Valturio]] much improves on the design in 1463 by devising a boat with five sets of parallel cranks which are all joined to a single power source by one [[connecting rod]]; the idea is also taken up by his compatriot [[Francesco di Giorgio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 114&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Rotary grindstone with treadle]]''' 

Evidence for rotary grindstones operated by a crank handle goes back to the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1480, the crank mechanism is further mechanized by adding a [[treadle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Geared hand-mill'''

The geared hand-mill, operated either with one or two cranks, appears in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;White, Jr. 1962, 111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 16th century ===
[[File:Early Modern Grenade Rifles, Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, München. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|German grenade [[musket]]s from the 16th century (the two upper ones)]]
'''[[Grenade rifle|Grenade musket]]'''

Two 16th century German grenade [[musket]]s working with a [[wheellock]] mechanism are on display in the [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]], Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, München, Inv. nos. W 1450, W 1451&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical drawings of artist-engineers ==
{{HistOfTech}}
The revived scientific spirit of the age can perhaps be best exemplified by the voluminous corpus of [[technical drawing]]s which the artist-engineers left behind, reflecting the wide variety of interests the Renaissance [[Homo universalis]] pursued. The establishment of the laws of linear perspective by [[Brunelleschi]] gave his successors, such as [[Taccola]], [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], a powerful instrument to depict mechanical devices for the first time in a realistic manner. The extant sketch books give modern historians of science invaluable insights into the standards of technology of the time. Renaissance engineers showed a strong proclivity to experimental study, drawing a variety of technical devices, many of which appeared for the first time in history on paper.

However, these designs were not always intended to be put into practice, and often practical limitations impeded the application of the revolutionary designs. For example, da Vinci's ideas on the conical [[parachute]] or the winged flying machine were only applied much later. While earlier scholars showed a tendency to attribute inventions based on their first pictorial appearance to individual Renaissance engineers, modern scholarship is more prone to view the devices as products of a technical evolution which often went back to the Middle Ages.

'''RedTacton''' is a Human Area Networking technology, which is under development, that uses the surface of the [[human body]] as a safe, high speed network transmission path. It is completely distinct from [[wireless]] and [[infrared]] technologies as it uses the minute electric field emitted on the surface of the human body. 

A transmission path is formed at the moment a part of the human body comes in contact with a RedTacton transceiver. Communication is possible using any body surfaces, such as the hands, fingers, arms, feet, face, legs or torso. RedTacton works through shoes and clothing as well. When the physical contact gets separated, the communication is ended.

Using RedTacton-enabled devices, music from a [[digital audio player]] in your pocket would pass through your clothing and shoot over your body to [[headphones]] in your ears. Instead of fiddling around with a cable to connect your [[digital camera]] to your computer, you could transfer pictures just by touching the PC while the camera is around your neck. And since data can pass from one body to another, you could also exchange electronic [[business card]]s by shaking hands, trade music files by dancing cheek to cheek, or swap [[telephone number|phone number]]s just by [[kiss]]ing.

==Features==

RedTacton has three main functional features:

* Touch - Touching, gripping, sitting, walking, stepping and other human movements can be the triggers for unlocking or locking, starting or stopping equipment, or obtaining data.

* Broadband and Interactive - Duplex, interactive communication is possible at a maximum speed of 10Mbps. Because the transmission path is on the surface of the body, transmission speed does not deteriorate in congested areas where many people are communicating at the same time.

* Any media - In addition to the human body, various conductors and dielectrics can be used as transmission media. Conductors and dielectrics may also be used in combination.

==Comparison with other network technologies==

The focus on ubiquitous service has brought about the shortening of distances in communication. RedTacton is positioned as the last 1m solution to ultimate close-range communication. Wireless communication creates connections when signals arrive, allowing for easy connections because connectors are unnecessary. However, seen from another aspect, the arriving signals can be intercepted, so security becomes an issue. Wired communication transmits data between two connection points, so interception is difficult and security can be considered to be high. However, connectors and cables are a nuisance. Taking the above points in account, RedTacton is situated directly between wireless and wired communication. In other words, RedTacton allows for easy connection without connectors, while at the same time allowing transmission of data only between two contact points. It thus has the feature of being difficult to intercept.

'''iRam''' is a new application of an old technology from [[Gigabyte Technology]]. It basically involves a [[PCI card]] with slots for up to 4[[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[DDR DRAM]] which is used like a normal disk drive. Their recommended application of this drive is to install an [[operating system]] on it, in order to increase [[booting]] speed. They claim an increase in up to 60-times the speed and can boot [[Windows XP]] in 5 seconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technological development''' is the process of [[research]] and [[New product development|development]] of [[technology]]. Many [[emerging technologies]] are expected to become generally applied in the near future.

The new technology development process leans on the [[New product development]] process. It starts with a new [[technology|technological]] idea, via [[research]] and [[New product development|development]] through to the use of a [[technology]] (e.g. by introducing products that are based on the new technology in market).

In general, [[Product (business)|products]] are not equal to [[technology|technologies]]. A product is based on several technologies and each technology is basis for several products. Life cycles of products and technologies also are different. However mostly, it is difficult to see the difference between products and technologies and people often confound these two terms &lt;ref&gt;Buergel, Haller, and Binder: F&amp;E-Management. p. 85. Vahlen, Muenchen (1996&lt;/ref&gt; . Then, the [[New product development]] process equals the new technology development process.

Examples of technological development include:
* [[Software engineering]]
* [[Biotechnology]]
* [[Nanotechnology]]

==Nanotechnology==
{{See|Nanotechnology}}
[[Carbon nanotubes]] can, as of April 2008, be synthesized to an extent of a few millimetres, which already makes them suitable as [[electric brushes]]. It's approaching [[Potential applications of carbon nanotubes|its many other potential applications]].

==Artificial intelligence==
{{Main|Progress in artificial intelligence}}
[[Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is a field in development. Currently, AI is superhuman in most board-games, but still Sub-human in [[Go (board game)|Go]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Computer Go#Computers versus humans]]&lt;/ref&gt; and most everyday tasks performed by humans.

==Energy==
{{Main|Energy development}}
''Energy development'' is the ongoing effort to provide [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[energy]] resources through knowledge, skills, and constructions. When [[wikt:harnessing|harnessing]] [[energy]] from [[primary energy]] sources and converting them into more convenient secondary [[energy forms]], such as [[electrical energy]] and cleaner [[fuel]], both emissions (reducing pollution) and quality (more efficient use) are important.

==Emerging technologies==
{{Main|List of emerging technologies}}
Examples of [[emerging technologies]] are [[Genetic engineering]] / [[Synthetic biology]], [[Electric cars]] with range extenders and [[Personal rapid transit]], [[Flash memory]] with smaller, faster, lower power consuming storage, [[Nanomaterials]], [[CVD diamond]], [[Scramjet]], [[Wireless communication]] with ubiquitous network connectivity, [[Anti-aging]] drugs, [[Semantic Web]] or [[Answers Machine]], more efficient [[Biofuel|bio fuels]], [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]s, [[Machine translation]] bob, [[Nuclear fusion power]], [[3D optical data storage]] or [[Holographic data storage]], [[Metamaterial]]s, [[3D display]]s, [[Quantum computer|Quantum computing]], [[Nanowire batteries]], [[Virtual retinal display]]s, [[WiTricity]] and [[WREL_(technology)|WREL]] ([[Wireless energy transfer]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, selection, and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that [[bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Welfare technology''' is technology that can help and assist users in their daily lives. Examples of welfare technology are intelligent aids such as cleaning robots, sensors in clothes, smart homes, etc. The concept of a welfare technology should be seen in a new discourse created in 2007 in [[Denmark]] [http://www.denmark.dk/en].

Welfare technology is closely linked to Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) but whereas AAL focuses on &quot;addressing the needs of the ageing population&quot; [http://www.aal169.org/], welfare technology addresses not only the elderly but also other users of public services such as the handicapped, schools, day care centres, abusers, etc. 

The discourse were created during a debate meeting [http://www.tekno.dk/subpage.php3?article=1339&amp;toppic=kategori7&amp;language=dk] in the Spring of 2007 hosted by the Danish Board of Technology, where new technologies in care were discussed. 

The [[European Union]] has become increasingly focused on finding new ways to reduce the burden of the elderly boom that is expected in the future. One example of this is the AAL-169 programme [http://www.aal169.org/]  - a new European technology and innovation funding programme. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The programme is intended to address the needs of the ageing population, to reduce innovation barriers of forthcoming promising markets, but also to lower future social security costs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;[http://www.aal-europe.eu/]

An example of a project that focuses on welfare technology is the EU-funded project called PERSONA [http://www.aal-persona.org/].

{{For|the nickname given to stage crew|Theatrical Technician}}
'''Techie''' is a term, derivative of the word ''[[technology]]'', for a person who displays a great, sometimes even obsessive, interest in technology, high-tech devices, and particularly [[computers]]. Some techies express a disregard for any technology that could possibly be considered obsolete, even if the technology or process in question might only be considered obsolete within the techie community. Consequently, techies are also often [[early adopter]]s. With the increased spending power of techies, a few media outlets exist that cater solely to them, most notably ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'', [[Slashdot]], and, while it existed, [[TechTV]].  [[Geek]]s or [[nerd]]s are often also considered to be techies; however, the reverse is not necessarily true and more people who would not be considered &quot;[[geek]]s&quot; are becoming techies, especially with the advancement of technology in recent years.

&quot;Techie&quot; is also used as a nickname (without pejorative connotations) for a student from a [[university]] with the name &quot;Technology&quot; in its title, such as [[Caltech]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], [[MIT]], [[Illinois Institute of Technology|IIT]], [[FIT]] and [[Virginia Tech]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

&quot;Techie&quot; (slang) is also a generalized occupational title for stagehands, electricians, carpenters or other professional Stage Technicians in the Theatre and Film Industries.  

In the recent years &quot;Techie&quot; slang is most commonly attached with professionals in the Information Technology sector which is the worlds most higly appreciated profession in terms of its financial returns for an individual and social status and large number of professionals in this job area. Mostly anyone with any designation like Software Engineer, Analyst, Project Manager, General Manager, Line Of Business Head, and all will be generally grouped under &quot;Techie&quot; label in the IT industry.

In the UK, many major police [[custody suite]]s are now equipped with Live Scan machines, which allow for suspects' fingerprints to be instantly compared with a national database, [[IDENT1]], with results usually reported in less than ten minutes.

It is important to clean Live Scan &quot;equipment regularly and calibrate routinely per the manufacturers guidelines, to ensure the quality and integrity of the fingerprint images.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/takingfps.html Taking Legible Fingerprints], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology Dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[Science and Technology Studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from “internal factors” as well as from “external factors”. Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the “inherent progress” of human [[history]], nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials. 

Conversely, modern Technology Dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not “self-evident” or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of [[technology development]] and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. In this sense, Technology Dynamics aims at overcoming distinct “internal” and “external” points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a “thick description” of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and by the same token it provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of ‘path dependence’ are crucial in explaining technological change. Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of Technology Dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==

•       [[Social Construction of Technology]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Actor-network theory]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Systems theory]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Normalization Process Theory]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	Quasi-evolutionary theories
&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Innovation system]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

•	[[Technology assessment]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	[[Backcasting]]
&lt;br /&gt;•	Strategic Niche Management 
&lt;br /&gt;•	Transition Management

'''Open for Business''' (OFB) is an online general interest publication with a technology focus. It features articles on a variety of topics, including computers, technology, politics, current events, theology and philosophy. The site also recently launched a new fiction section that will include short stories and poetry.

==History==
OFB was founded on October 5, 2001 as the &quot;open source migration guide&quot;. It was started by Timothy R. Butler after a mailing list discussion prompted him to feel there was a need for a site that would point to articles and whitepapers discussing migration to [[Linux]]. Originally, OFB featured very little original content, instead mimicking Slashdot and other similar sites that included little more than a few small comments on the articles posted. Tim was assisted early on by Steven Hatfield, who helped add postings to the site.

The site started to shift early on, as an increasing amount of Free and Open Source news was included. About a month after the site was founded the first original editorial content appeared and OFB continued to publish approximately one original work per month after that. In late April 2002, Butler announced a relaunch of the site that included a reduction in links to other sites and a further increase in original content. The relaunch also brought forth the first version of OFB's blue sphere logo and the new tagline &quot;the Independent Journal of Open Source Migration&quot;.

On July 4, 2002, Open for Business joined with LinuxandMain.com, KernelTrap.org and Device Forge's LinuxDevices and DesktopLinux.com to form LinuxDailyNews (LDN), an aggregation site that was to help increase the publicity of independent open source news sites and raise their stature in a market that had consolidated into a few large networks of sites. LDN featured a center column that showed story highlights and two side columns that displayed all stories from the member sites in blocks. The site was launched as part of DesktopLinux.com's &quot;wIndependence Day&quot; promotion and featured an early spike in popularity thanks to a mention on Slashdot.org. In progressing months, however, the site's traffic decreased and the lack of a common method of promotion and navigation among member sites diminished any real sense of a network. The site would be taken down in 2004 after a hacker managed to deface the site; although plans existed to restore the site, they were never followed through with and Device Forge assumed the rights to LDN's domain name.

Open for Business continued increasing its range of content. In February 2003, the site finalized its transition to an original content provider, as opposed to a site of links, by moving non-original content to a separate &quot;News Watch&quot; section. New contributing editor Ed Hurst began a series on his switch to FreeBSD in September 2003, beginning a long running, extremely popular series of accessible FreeBSD articles&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofb.biz/series/freebsddesktop.html OFB]&lt;/ref&gt; that Hurst continued to add to as late as October 2006. Butler also picked up a new operating system around that time, beginning OFB's coverage of Apple computers. OFB's second associate editor, Eduardo Sánchez returned in mid-2004 as a contributing editor, adding to the variety of articles. Hurst was promoted to associate editor simultaneously.

The site continued in a similar fashion, with its mix of coverage on Linux, BSD and Mac OS X through early 2006. During this period it adopted the updated motto &quot;the Independent Journal of Open Standards and Open Source&quot;. Due to other obligations, the site's editors ceased writing content for the site in early 2006, though it remained open during this period.

In recognition of Open for Business's fifth anniversary, Butler announced the relaunch of the site on October 5, 2006. The new OFB adopted the site's current general interest focus, continuing, but de-emphasizing, its past emphasis on Open Source and technology. The site shed its purple and blue, PHP-Nuke-based design that had gone with only minor modifications since the site's original launch for a simpler, content oriented design using a custom backend. The old site was archived as OFB Classic to preserve access to popular past articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{dablink|This article is about Hardware Architecture; the term refers to the architectural design of a physical device, or system, often comprising both hardware and software. For other uses, see for example [[Computer Architecture]], [[Computer Hardware]] or [[Architecture (disambiguation)]].}}

In engineering, '''hardware architecture''' refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships. This description, often called a '''hardware design model''', allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides software component designers important information needed for software development and integration. Clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., electrical and mechanical engineering) to work more effectively together to develop and manufacture new machines, devices and components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rai, L. &amp; Kang, S.J. |title=Rule-based modular software and hardware architecture for multi-shaped robots using real-time dynamic behavior identification and selection |journal=Knowledge-Based Systems |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=273–283 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hardware'' is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the ([[electronic computer]]) hardware from the ''software'' which runs in it.  But ''hardware,'' within the [[automation]] and [[software engineering]] disciplines, need not simply be a computer of some sort.  A modern automobile runs vastly more ''software'' than the Apollo spacecraft. Also, modern aircraft cannot function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardward components such as IC wired logic gates, analog and hybrid devices, and other digital components. The need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications, including computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, surgical instrumentation, satellites, and submarines.

Hardware architecture is therefore the representation of an engineered (or ''to be engineered'') electronic or electromechanical hardware system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the [[design]](s) for such a system.  It is generally part of a larger integrated system encompassing [[information]], [[software]], and device [[prototyping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frampton, K.D., Martin, S.E. &amp; Minor, K. |title=The scaling of acoustic streaming for application in micro-fluidic devices |journal=Applied Acoustics |volume=64 |issue=7 |pages=681–692 |year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0003-682X(03)00005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a ''representation'' because it is used to convey information about the related [[wiktionary:element|elements]] comprising a hardware system, the relationships among those elements, and the [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] governing those relationships.

[[Image:Schnittbild drehnatrieb 01.jpg|thumb|left|Electric multi-turn actuator with controls.]]

It is a ''process'' because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or change the architecture, and/or a design from that architecture, of a hardware system within a [[set]] of [[constraints]].

It is a ''discipline'' because a [[body]] of [[knowledge]] is used to inform [[practitioner]]s as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints.

A hardware architecture is primarily concerned with the internal electrical (and, more rarely, the [[Electromechanics|mechanical]]) [[Electrical connector|interface]]s among the system's [[software componentry|components]] or [[system|subsystem]]s, and the [[computer bus|interface]]  between the system and its external environment, especially the devices operated by or the electronic displays viewed by a [[User (computing)|user]].  (This latter, special interface, is known as the [[computer human interface]], ''AKA'' human computer interface, or [[Human-computer interaction|HCI]]; formerly called the man-machine interface.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunelli, C., Garzia, F. &amp; Nurmi, J. |title=A coarse-grain reconfigurable architecture for multimedia applications featuring subword computation capabilities |journal=Journal of Real-Time Image Processing |volume=3 |issue=1-2 |pages=21–32 |year=2008|doi=10.1007/s11554-008-0071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated circuit (IC) designers are driving current technologies into innovative approaches for new products. Hence, multiple layers of active devices are being proposed as single chip, opening up opportunities for disruptive microelectronic, optoelectronic, and new microelectromechanical hardware implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cale, T.S., Lu, J.-Q. &amp; Gutmann, R.J. |title=Three-dimensional integration in microelectronics: Motivation, processing, and thermomechanical modeling |journal=Chemical Engineering Communications |volume=195 |issue=8 |pages=847–888 |year=2008|doi=10.1080/00986440801930302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalcanti, A., Shirinzadeh, B., Zhang, M. &amp; Kretly, L.C. |title=Nanorobot  Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense |journal= Sensors |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=2932–2958 |year=2008 |doi=10.3390/s8052932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the terms system and hardware as they are still commonly used today.  However, with the arrival of digital computers on the scene and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered ''hardware'' artifacts, ''software'' artifacts, and the combined artifacts.  

A [[Computer program|programmable]] hardware artifact, or machine, that lacks its software program is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine.  However, a hardware machine and its software program can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks.  Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the terms hardware, software, and system came to be used to distinguish among the hardware which could run a [[software program]], the software program itself, and the hardware device complete with its program, respectively.

The ''hardware'' engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the ''software'' engineer or architect deals (more or less) exclusively with the software program; and the ''systems'' engineer or [[systems architect]] is responsible for seeing that the software program is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function.

A hardware architecture, then, is an abstract representation of an electronic and/or an electromechanical device which is capable of running a fixed or changeable program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Assif, D., Himel, R. &amp; Grajower, Y. |title=A new electromechanical device to measure the accuracy of interocclusal records |journal=Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=672–676 |year=1988|pmid=3165452 |doi=10.1016/0022-3913(88)90380-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zimmermann, M., Volden, T., Kirstein, K.-U., Hafizovic, S., Lichtenberg, J., Brand, O. &amp; Hierlemann, A. |title=A CMOS-based integrated-system architecture for a static cantilever array |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=254–264 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2007.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hardware architecture generally includes some form of analog, digital, or hybrid electronic computer, along with electronic and mechanical sensors and actuators. Hardware architecting may be viewed as a 'partitioning [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]],' or [[algorithm]], which considers all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements and arranges the necessary hardware components into a workable set of cleanly [[bounded]] [[subsystem]]s with no more parts than are required.  That is, it is a partitioning scheme which is [[exclusive]], [[inclusive]], and [[exhaustive]].  A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the hardware subsystems so that there is a minimum of electrical connections and electronic communications needed among them.  In both software and hardware, a good subsystem tends to be seen as a meaningful &quot;[[object (computer science)|object]].&quot;  Moreover, a clear allocation of user requirements to the architecture (hardware and software) provides an effective basis for [[Verification and Validation|validation tests]] of the user's requirements in the as-built system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Orphaned technology''' is a descriptive term for [[computer]] products, programs, and platforms that have been abandoned by their original developers.  Orphaned technology refers to [[software]], such as [[abandonware]] and antique software, but also to [[hardware]] and practices.  In computer software standards and documentation, [[deprecation]] is the gradual phasing-out of a software or [[programming language]] feature.

For users of superior technologies that have been withdrawn from the market, there is a choice between maintaining their surrounding environments in some form of emulation or switching to other supported products and losing those capabilities.

Examples of orphaned technologies that still have or had a following after being dropped include [[DEC Alpha]] [[microprocessor]], [[LISP machines]], [[Apple Lisa]], [[NeXT]], [[OpenDoc]], the [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]] (Apple Newton), [[HyperCard]], the [[Prograph]] visual programming system, and the [[Apple II]] series of computers, and [[Mac OS|Classic Mac OS]].  Symbolics Inc.'s operating systems, Genera and OpenGenera were twice orphaned, as they were ported from LISP machines to computers using the Alpha [[64-bit]] CPU.
User groups often exist for specific orphaned technologies, such as The [[Hong Kong]] Newton User Group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crmloyalty.com/hknug/&lt;/ref&gt;, Symbolics Lisp [Machines] Users' Group&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ai.sri.com/mailing-lists/slug/&lt;/ref&gt;, and Newton Reference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panix.com/~clay/newton/&lt;/ref&gt;

Orphan technologies also refer to technologies for which there is a need, but not a large enough market to make investment in the technology financially viable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''lock-out device''' is a system which, in its most common form, is designed to detect the first signal(s) it receives, and ignore subsequent signals. The most well-known application of this technology is in [[game show]]s; particularly trivia shows. Lock-out devices are used to determine in real-time which contestant has signaled first; typically in response to some prompt, such as a trivia question. The signal typically results in the contestant earning some sort of control in the game, such as the right to answer the trivia question first. The system provides some indication of which contestant has signaled, such as a light for each contestant, allowing the relevant parties to clearly determine who has signaled first.

The device used by a contestant to send a signal to the lock-out system is called a '''signaling device''' (or more commonly a '''buzzer''', perhaps due to the sound some early devices used to indicate signaling). They are typically a button on a hand-held cylinder or mounted on a podium in front of the contestant. The act of signaling is commonly called ringing in, or buzzing in. 

==History==
Lock-out devices were not always mainstays in game shows. Early game shows lacked this technology, and those that required it made use of alternate, less-precise, systems. For example, the 1969 game show ''[[He Said, She Said (game show)|He Said, She Said]]'' required contestants to raise their hands, while the host and production staff determined visually which had raised their hands first. A similar, but more technical system was actually used in the earlier game show ''[[Winner Take All (game show)|Winner Take All]]''; the show was one of, if not the first applications of this forerunner of the modern lock-out. On the show, two contestants competed at answering trivia questions, with the first to ring in earning the right to answer. However, the technology was not yet developed for a lock-out system. Instead, each contestant's hand signal sounded a different sound effect (a buzzer and a bell, perhaps influencing the future terms of ringing or buzzing in). Whichever was deemed to have sounded first was considered to have control. A modern lock-out device essentially utilizes some sort of electronic system to do the determining with precision and certainty, rather than by human observation.

In general, though, a majority of early multi-player game shows - even those dealing with trivia - simply lacked the gameplay element of pitting contestants against each other simultaneously. Competitive game shows instead took to having contestants alternate turns, such as in ''[[Twenty One (game show)|Twenty One]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', and ''[[Password (TV series)|Password]]''.

Perhaps the most famous modern game show to use a lock-out device is ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', which uses a sophisticated system that is so fundamental to the game, mastering the signaling device is commonly said to be as or more important than knowing the answers to the questions. On ''Jeopardy!'' (and its various spinoffs), the lock-out device has several advanced features. When the host finishes reading the question, a production assistant activates the lockout device, and the border of the game board lights up (which home viewers don't see). Only at this point are contestants allowed to ring in. If a contestant rings in before the system and lights are activated, their signaling device is deactivated for a fraction of a second. Poor performance has been regularly blamed on failure to master the lock-out system, and on celebrity editions, celebrity contestants have been known to jokingly claim their signaling devices to be broken.

In 2000, sister show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', aided by a new computerized video board, introduced a segment called &quot;Toss-up Puzzles&quot; which introduced lock-out devices to that show as well. In these short rounds, contestants would have to ring in to guess the answer to a puzzle whose letters were randomly revealed one at a time until solved. Currently, three of these rounds are played per show, with two of them determining who will start play in the subsequent standard round.

Other lock-out devices can have more complex operations. On another [[Merv Griffin]] game show, ''[[Merv Griffin's Crosswords|Crosswords]]'', the two competing contestants are joined in the second round by three &quot;spoilers&quot; who can replace one of the main contestants if they ring in and answer correctly. However, the two main contestants are always given an opportunity to answer first if they ring in, even if it is later than the spoiler. This results in a five-way system in which the order of ringing in is displayed on the front of each podium; One or two on the main contestant's podiums, and one to three on the spoilers'. Should all five players ring in on a question, the host can ask each of the main contestants for an answer in the order they rang in before moving on to the spoilers in the order they rang in (should no one provide the correct answer) by using the numbers on the podiums.

'''Technophobia''' is the fear or dislike of advanced [[technology]] or complex devices, especially [[computers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dic defs&quot;

[Origin: 1960–65; techno- + -phobia] —Related forms: tech·no·phobe, noun &amp;mdash;(Dictionary.com unabridged (v1.1) based on the Random House unabridged Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2006.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is generally used in the sense of an irrational fear, but others contend fears are justified. It is the opposite of [[technophilia]]. First receiving widespread notice during the [[Industrial Revolution]], technophobia has been observed to affect various societies and communities throughout the world. This has caused some groups to take stances against some modern technological developments in order to preserve their ideologies. In some of these cases, the new technologies conflict with established beliefs, such as personal values in simplicity and modest lifestyles. A number of examples of technophobic ideas can be found in multiple forms of art, ranging from literary works such as ''[[Frankenstein]]'' to films like ''[[Metropolis_(film)|Metropolis]]'' and ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs]]''. Many of these works portray the darker side of technology as seen by the technophobic. As technologies become increasingly complex and difficult to understand, people are more likely to harbor anxieties relating to their use of modern technologies.

A study published in the journal ''{{plainlinks|http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/759/description#description |Computers in human behavior}}'' was conducted between 1992 and 1994 surveying first-year college students across various countries.&lt;ref name=studentstudy&gt;{{cite web

  |quote=Over a two-year period, from 1992 - 1994, data were collected from 3,392 first year university students in 38 universities from 23 countries on their level of technological sophistication and level of technophobia. Technological sophistication was measured by the use of consumer technology (video-cassette recorder, microwave ovens, automated banking, computer/video games), university computing (classroom computer use, word processing experience, programming experience and use of library computers) and computer ownership. Technophobia was assessed by [http://www.csudh.edu/psych/meas.htm instruments]  measuring computer anxiety, computer cognitions and computer attitudes.

First, a group of countries including Indonesia, Poland, India, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Mexico and Thailand show large percentages (over 50%) of technophobic students. In contrast, there are five countries which show under 30% technophobes (USA, Yugoslavia - Croatia, Singapore, Israel and Hungary). The remaining countries were in between these two groupings.&quot;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, [[Japan]] had 58% high-level technophobes, [[India]] had 82%, and [[Mexico]] had 53%.&lt;ref name=&quot;W&amp;R table-2&quot; /&gt;

A published report in 2000 stated that roughly 85 to 90 percent of new employees at an organization may be uncomfortable with new technology, and are technophobic to some degree.&lt;ref name=orgstudy&gt;[http://www.learningcircuits.org/2000/mar2000/mar2000_elearn.html], E-Learning 1.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Technophobia began to gain national and international attention as a movement with the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. With the development of new machines able to do the work of skilled craftsmen using unskilled, underpaid women and children, those who worked a trade began to fear for their livelihoods. In 1675, a group of weavers destroyed machines that replaced their jobs. By 1727, the destruction had become so prevalent [[Parliament]] made the demolition of machines a capital offense. This action, however, did not stop the tide of violence. The [[Luddites]], a group of anti-technology workers, united under the name “Ludd” in March 1811, removing key components from knitting frames, raiding houses for supplies, and petitioning for trade rights while threatening greater violence. Poor harvests and food riots lent aid to their cause by creating a restless and agitated population for them to draw supporters from.&lt;ref name=lud&gt;[http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/kevin.binfield/luddites/LudditeHistory.htm], History of Luddites.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nineteenth century was also the beginning of modern science, with the work of [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Henri Becquerel]], and [[Marie Curie]], and inventors such as [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. The world was changing rapidly, too rapidly for many, who feared the changes taking place and longed for a simpler time. The [[Romantic movement]] exemplified these feelings. Romantics tended to believe in imagination over reason, the “organic” over the mechanical, and a longing for a simpler, more [[pastoral]] times. Poets like [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]] believed that the technological changes that were taking place as a part of the industrial revolution were polluting their cherished view of nature as being perfect and pure.&lt;ref name=romanticism&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html], Romanticism.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], a fear of technology continued to grow, catalyzed by the bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. With [[nuclear proliferation]] and the [[Cold War]], people began to wonder what would become of the world now that humanity had the power to destroy it. In the post-WWII era, [[environmentalism]] also took off as a movement. The first international air pollution conference was held in 1955, and in the 1960s, investigations into the lead content of gasoline sparked outrage among environmentalists. In the 1980s, the depletion of the ozone layer and the threat of global warming began to be taken more seriously.&lt;ref name=environment&gt;[http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/], Environmentalism Timeline.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technophobic groups==
Several societal groups may be considered technophobic, most recognizable are the [[Amish]] and the [[Luddites]].  Many technophobic groups revolt against modern technology because of their beliefs that these technologies are threatening to their ways of life and livelihoods.&lt;ref name=Jobs&gt;[http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/luddites.html], The Luddites.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Luddites were a [[social movement]] of British artisans in the 19th century who organized in opposition to technological advances in the textile industry.&lt;ref name=lud /&gt; These advances would have replaced many skilled textile artisans with comparatively unskilled machinists. The Amish are considered technophobic because of their aversion to many modern technologies. Amish focus on maintaining their social order that emphasizes community, simplicity, and religion.&lt;ref name=ami&gt;[http://www.shawcreekgeneralstore.com/amish_article1.htm], The Amish.&lt;/ref&gt; Their leadership weighs heavily the social impact new technologies can have on traditions of social independence from external political and economic power structures.

There are several similarities between the Amish and [[Old Order Mennonite]]s. The Mennonites share in their focus on community, simplicity, and religion, only to different degrees. The Old Order Mennonites are a separated fraction from the Lancaster Conference. These Old Order Mennonites have religious sanctions against many “modern technologies”, yet allow for some items, such as farm equipment and some simple vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Daniel: &quot;Old Order Mennonites&quot;, Burnham Inc Publishers, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technophobia in arts==
An early example of technophobia in fiction and popular culture is [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''. It has been a staple of [[science fiction]] ever since, exemplified by movies like Fritz Lang's [[Metropolis_(film)|&quot;Metropolis&quot;]], which offer an example of how technophobia can occur, and [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Modern Times (film)|&quot;Modern Times&quot;]], in which people are reduced to nothing but cogs in the machinery, a product of new industrial techniques like the [[assembly line]]. This persisted through the 1950s, with the fears of [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[radiation]] leading to giant insects of [[monster movie]]s, as well as [[cautionary tale]]s like [[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;]], and into the 1960s, with the likes of [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. It was joined by fears of superintelligent machines, and rebellion against them, which was a recurring theme of [[Star Trek]], from the original series to [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|&quot;ST:TNG&quot;]] to [[Star Trek: Voyager|&quot;Voyager&quot;]] in the 1990s.

Also in the 1960s, the film ''[[Omega Man]]'' (loosely based on the [[Richard Matheson]] novel ''[[I_Am_Legend_(novel)|I am Legend]]'') showed a world scarred by [[biological warfare]] and only a handful of humans and a cult of mutants remain alive. [[Charlton Heston|Charlton Heston's]] character is a scientist who is being targeted by the mutants who wish to destroy all science and machinery due to their technophobic beliefs. Technophobia is also thematic in [[Walter M. Miller]]'s novel ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', where nuclear war produces an attempt to stamp out science itself as held to be responsible.

In the 1970s, [[Colossus: The Forbin Project|&quot;The Forbin Project&quot;]] and &quot;[[Demon Seed]]&quot; also offered samples of domination by computers. Also in the 1970s, [[Rich Buckler]] created [[Deathlok the Demolisher|Deathlok]], a [[cyborg]] revivified by a madman as a slave killing machine, a dark twist on Frankenstein.

Technophobia achieved commercial success in the 1980s  with the movie ''[[The Terminator]]'', in which a computer becomes self-aware, and decides to kill all humans.  ''[[Blade Runner]]'' shows us how human replicas were able to live on Earth, portraying technology gone wrong in &quot;replicants&quot; unhappy with their man-made limitations which demand they be &quot;modified&quot;. &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; introduced another twist, when &quot;surplus&quot; [[Emergency Medical Hologram|EMH]]s, such sophisticated [[expert system]]s as to be almost indistinguishable from human, being [[Author, Author (Star Trek: Voyager)|effectively reduced to slavery]], while [[Flesh and Blood (Star Trek: Voyager)|other]] similar systems were turned into [[Hirogen|sentient prey]].

More recently there have been movies like [[I, Robot (film)|''I, Robot'']], [[The Matrix Trilogy]], ''[[WALL-E]]'', and the Terminator sequels. Shows such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' - most specifically in the episode ''[[Robots of Death]]'' - have also tackled the issue of technophobia, with a character in ''Robots of Death'' displaying a great fear of robots due to their lack of body language, described by the [[Fourth Doctor]] as giving them the appearance of 'dead men walking'. Series consultant [[Kit Pedler]] also used this fear as a basis for the inspiration of classic ''Doctor Who'' monsters the [[Cybermen]], with the creatures being inspired by his own fear of [[artificial limbs]] becoming so common that it would become impossible to know when someone had stopped being a man and become simply a machine. ''[[Virtuosity]]'' speaks of a virtual serial killer who manages to escape to the real world. He goes on a rampage before he is inevitably stopped.  This is a true technophobic movie in that its main plot is about technology gone wrong. It introduces a killer who blatantly destroys people.&lt;ref name=scifi&gt;Technophobia: Science Fiction Visions of Posthuman Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Pixar]] film ''WALL-E'' humans are shown to have evolved into obese, docile, and lazy people as a result of robots now be able to do everything for them.  

Godfrey Reggio's [[Qatsi trilogy]] also deals heavily with issues of technophobia. The idea of keeping the &quot;thinkers&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; separate shows us that even the people who embraced technology feared the potential of it in some way.

'''Platform technology''' is a term for [[technology]] that enables the creation of products and processes that support present or future development. It establishes the long-term capabilities of research &amp; development institutes.
In pharmaceutical industry the Platform technology is of great importance for easing the future research work. Suppose if a researcher formulates a new dosage form using a certain drug along with the optimized amount of [[excipients]], then the same excipients can be used by other researchers, just changing the active ingredient and acquiring a new drug delivery dosage form. This would ensure less time and money being spent on finalizing the concentration, amount, type, etc of excipients used. Thus, more stress can be given on studies related to the active drug. For example, if a person formulates an Ophthalmic solution using certain polymers as excipients, then a platform technology can be established where-in other researchers can use the optimized polymers, and just change the active drug, leading to formulation of a whole new drug-dosage, with less money and time spent on the selection of the excipients.
Thus, Platform technology creates a platform for the researchers to formulate new drug-dosages, without working much on the already optimized excipients.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Technology assessment''' ('''TA''', German ''Technikfolgenabschätzung'') is the study and [[evaluation]] of new [[technology|technologies]]. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the [[scientific community]] are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of [[ethics|ethical]] implications. Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that [[scientist]]s normally are not trained [[ethicist]]s themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or [[work in progress]].

Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is [[future]]-oriented rather than backward-looking or anti-technological. (&quot;Scientific research and science-based technological innovation is an indispensable prerequisite of modern life and civilization. There is no alternative. For six or eight billion people there is no way back to a less sophisticated life style.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Mohr]]: &quot;Technology Assessment in Theory and Practice&quot;, ''Techné: Journal of the Society for Philosophy and Technology'', Vol. 4, No. 4 (Summer, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;). TA considers its task as interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the [[commercialisation|commercialization]] of new technologies. Therefore any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with [[politician|political decision-makers]].

The [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) assesses [[technology maturity]] using a measure called [[Technology readiness level]].

The [[ETC Group]] has proposed an international treaty for technology assessment - entitled [[ICENT]] - International Convention for The Evaluation of New Technologies

Some of the major fields of TA are:

* [[information technology]]
* [[hydrogen technologies]]
* [[nuclear technology]]
* [[molecular nanotechnology]]
* [[pharmacology]]
* [[organ donation|organ transplant]]s
* [[biotechnology|gene technology]]
* [[artificial intelligence]]
* [[health technology assessment]]

'''''Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology''''' is a book written by [[Neil Postman]] in 1992 that describes the development and characteristics of a &quot;technopoly&quot;. He defines a technopoly as a society in which technology is deified, meaning “the culture seeks its authorisation in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology”. It is characterised by a surplus of information generated by technology, which technological tools are in turn employed to cope with, in order to provide direction and purpose for society and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Postman, ''Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1993), p.71-2 ISBN 9780679745402&lt;/ref&gt;
 

Postman considers technopoly to be the most recent of three kinds of cultures distinguished by shifts in their attitude towards technology – tool-using cultures, technocracies, and technopolies. Each, he says, is produced by the emergence of new technologies that &quot;compete with old ones…mostly for dominance of their worldviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tool-using culture==
 
According to Postman, a tool-using culture employs technologies only to solve physical problems, as spears, cooking utensils, and [[water mill]]s do, and to &quot;serve the symbolic world&quot; of [[religion]], [[art]], [[politics]] and [[tradition]], as tools used to construct [[cathedrals]] do&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.23&lt;/ref&gt;. He claims that all such cultures are either [[theocracy|theocratic]] or &quot;unified by some metaphysical theory&quot;, which forced tools to operate within the bounds of a controlling ideology and made it &quot;almost impossible for technics to subordinate people to its own needs&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.26&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Technocracy==
In a technocracy, rather than existing in harmony with a theocratic world-view, tools are central to the &quot;thought-world&quot; of the culture. Postman claims that tools &quot;attack culture…[and] bid to become culture&quot;, subordinating existing traditions, politics, and religions. Postman cites the example of the [[telescope]] destroying the [[Judeo-Christian]] belief that the Earth is the centre of the [[solar system]], bringing about a &quot;collapse…of the moral centre of gravity in the West&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Postman characterises a technocracy as compelled by the &quot;impulse to invent&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.41&lt;/ref&gt; an ideology first advocated by [[Francis Bacon]] in the early 17th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.35&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that human beings could acquire knowledge about the natural world and use it to &quot;improve the lot of mankind&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Tiles]] and [[Hans Oberdiek]], ''Living in a Technological Culture: Human Tools and Human Values'' (New York: Routledge, 1995), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;, which led to the idea of invention for its own sake and the idea of progress&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''op. cit.'', p.42, 45&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Postman, this thinking became widespread in Europe from the late 18th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

 
However, a technocratic society remains loosely controlled by social and religious traditions, he clarifies. For instance, he states that the United States remained bound to notions of &quot;holy men and sin, grandmothers and families, regional loyalties and two-thousand-year-old traditions&quot; at the time of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.41, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technopoly==

Postman defines technopoly as a &quot;totalitarian technocracy&quot;, which demands the &quot;submission of all forms of cultural life to the sovereignty of technique and technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing Ellul’s 1964 conceptualisation of technology as autonomous, &quot;self-determinative&quot; independently of human action, and undirected in its growth&lt;ref&gt;Tiles and Oberdiek, ''ibid.'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt;, technology in a time of Technopoly actively eliminates all other ‘thought-worlds’. Thus, it reduces human life to finding meaning in machines and technique.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''op. cit.'', p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

This is exemplified, in Postman’s view, by the computer, the &quot;quintessential, incomparable, near-perfect&quot; technology for a technopoly. It establishes sovereignty over all areas of human experience based on the claim that it &quot;'thinks' better than we can&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

 
===Values of &quot;technological theology&quot;===

A technopoly is founded on the belief that technique is superior to lax, ambiguous and complex human thinking and judgement, in keeping with one of [[Frederick W. Taylor]]’s ‘Principles of scientific management’.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.51-2&lt;/ref&gt; It values efficiency, precision, and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

 
It also relies upon the &quot;elevation of information to a metaphysical status: information as both the means and end of human creativity&quot;. The idea of progress is overcome by the goal of obtaining information for its own sake&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, a technopoly is characterised by a lack of a cultural coherence or a &quot;transcendent sense of purpose or meaning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt; 

 
Postman attributes the origins of technopoly to ‘scientism’, the belief held by early social scientists including [[Auguste Compte]] that the practices of natural and social science would reveal the truth of human behaviour and provide &quot;an empirical source of moral authority&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

         
===Consequences of technopoly===

Postman refers to [[Harold Innis]]’ concept of &quot;knowledge monopolies&quot; to explain the manner in which technology usurps power in a technopoly. New technologies transform those who can create and use them into an &quot;elite group&quot;, a [[knowledge monopoly]], which is granted &quot;undeserved authority and prestige by those who have no such competence&quot;. Subsequently, Postman claims, those outside of this monopoly are led to believe in the false &quot;wisdom&quot; offered by the new technology, which has little relevance to the average person.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.9, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Postman also argues that the information endlessly generated by technologies in a technopoly, particularly communications technologies, result in &quot;information glut&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.60&lt;/ref&gt; [[Telegraphy]] and [[photography]], he states, redefined information from something that sought out to solve particular problems to a commodity that is potentially irrelevant to the receiver. Thus, in technopoly, &quot;information appears indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, in enormous volume at high speeds, and disconnected from theory, meaning, or purpose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.67-70&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Postman claims that this surplus of information results in a lack of understanding, since &quot;technology deprives us of the social, political, [[history|historical]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[logic|logical]], or [[spiritualism|spiritual]] bases for knowing what is beyond belief&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.58&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he argues that too much information leads to the inevitable refutation of any theory, causing information to become &quot;essentially meaningless&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

 
He also describes some more tangible implications of the excess of information produced in a technopoly, including ‘[[iatrogenics]]’ (treatment-induced illnesses) in the medical field&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt; and the understanding of individuals through &quot;invisible technologies&quot; like IQ tests and opinion polls.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

 
A technopoly also trivialises significant cultural and religious symbols through their endless reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.165&lt;/ref&gt; Postman echoes [[Jean Baudrillard]] in this view, who theorises that &quot;technique as a medium quashes…the ‘message’ of the product (its use value)&quot;, since a symbol’s &quot;social finality gets lost in seriality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Baudrillard]], &quot;Symbolic Exchange and Death&quot; in Mark Poster (ed.), ''Jean Baudrillard: Selected Writings (2nd Ed.)&quot; (Cambridge: Polity, 2001), p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of ‘Technopoly’==
===Technological determinism===
Postman’s argument is based on the premise that the uses of a technology are determined by its characteristics – &quot;its functions follow from its form&quot;. This draws on McLuhan’s theory that &quot;the medium is the message&quot; because it controls the scale and form of human interaction&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Quentin Fiore]], ''[[The Medium is the Massage]]'' (San Francisco: Hardwired, 1967), p.1, 7&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, Postman claims that once introduced, each technology &quot;plays out its hand&quot;”&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''op. cit.'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;, leaving its users to be, in Thoreau’s words, “tools of our tools”&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''ibid.'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to Tiles and Oberdiek, this pessimistic understanding of pervasive technology renders individuals &quot;strangely impotent&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tiles and Oberdiek, ''op. cit.'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt;. [[David Croteau]] and [[William Hoynes]] criticise such technologically deterministic arguments for underestimating the agency of a technology’s users.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Croteau]] and [[William Hoynes]], ''Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences (3rd ed.)'' (Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press, 2003), p.306&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Neuman]] suggests that ordinary people skilfully organise, filter, and skim information, and actively “seek out” information rather than feeling overwhelmed by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Star]], &quot;Machine Dreams&quot;, ''[[New Republic]]'', vol.207, no.5 (July 1992), p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It has also been argued that technologies are shaped by social factors more so than by their inherent properties. Star suggests that Postman neglects to account for the &quot;actual development, adaptation and regulation of technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Star, ''op. cit.'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Values===
According to Tiles and Oberdiek, pessimistic accounts of technology overriding culture are based on a particular vision of human values. They emphasise &quot;artistic creativity, intellectual culture, development of interpersonal relations, or religion as being the realms in which human freedom finds expression and in which human fulfilment is to be found&quot;. They suggest that technological optimists merely adhere to an alternative worldview that values the &quot;exercise of reason in the service of free will&quot; and the ability of technological developments to &quot;serve human ends&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tiles and Oberdiek, ''op. cit.'', p.29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and ideology===
Postman’s characterisation of technology as an ideological being has also been criticised. He refers to the &quot;god&quot; of technopolists speaking of &quot;efficiency, precision, objectivity&quot;, and hence eliminating the notions of sin and evil which exist in a separate &quot;moral universe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''op. cit.'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Weir]] argues that technologies are &quot;not ideological beings that take…near-anthropomorphic control of people’s loves, beliefs and aspirations&quot;. He in fact suggests that new technologies have had remarkably little effect on pre-existing human beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Weir]], &quot;Apocalypse, Wow&quot;, ''[[The Nation]]'', vol.255, no.6 (August 1992), p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence of old world ideologies===
Postman speaks of technological change as &quot;ecological…one significant change generates total change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, ''op. cit.'', p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, technopoly brought about by [[communications technologies]] must result in a drastic change in the beliefs of a society, such that prior &quot;thought worlds&quot; of ritual, myth, and religion cannot exist. Star conversely argues that new tools may create new environments, but do &quot;not necessarily extinguish older beliefs or the ability to act pragmatically upon them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Star, ''op. cit.'', p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SigmaTel Motion Video''' or short, '''SMV''' is a technology that was available as add-on feature for own STMP3500 Software Development Kit(SDK). SMV is a partially compressed video format. SMV allows users to transform common PC video files and watch them on their [[Portable multimedia player|MP4 players (PMP)]]. SMV is a video format used by [[SigmaTel]] or other players based on their chipsets.&lt;ref name=&quot;format&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ednindia.com/article-4840-sigmateloffersvideoplaybackforportablemultimediaplayers-Asia.html|title=Sigmatel Offers Video Playback for Portable Multimedia Players|date=2005-12-21|work=EDN India|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Principles==

The format is based on uncompressed audio concatenated with a sequence of [[JPEG]] images, each containing a set of frames. By padding smaller JPEG images to the size of the largest image of the video, the position of a specific frame in the file can be easily calculated at any time in the video. So also is the audio. The format is based on simple audio and video formats, so it can be easily implemented in hardware using little more than audio and image decoders.

JPEG is a variable bitrate image format and the video compression in SMV requires constant bitrate. Thus, the padding is necessary and introduces unused payload to the file. An encoder may try different quality settings for the JPEG files to as closely as possible match a pre-set size. Padding will still be required, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of '''technology policy''' or '''engineering and policy''' is taught at multiple universities. 

Classic [[political science]] teaches technology as a black box. Similarly [[economics]] treats technology as a residual to explain otherwise inexplicable growth. The creation of the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] addressed the fact that policy can not treat all technologies as identical based on their social or economic variables.  Technology policy is distinct from [[science studies]] but both claim [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] as a founder, while technology policy recognizes the importance of [[Vannevar Bush]].  Technology policy approaches science as the pursuit of verifiable or falsifiable hypotheses, while science studies has a post-modern view whereby science is belief-based and all truths are relative. Technology policy is rarely post-modern. Its goal is the improvement of policy and organizations based on an understanding of the underlying scientific and technological constraints and potential. For example, some clean coal technologies via carbon sequestration and the allocation of electromagnetic spectrum by auction are ideas that emerged from technology policy schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Expert-subject|Systems|date=February 2009}}  
'''Goal-orientation''' or goal-driven/goal-directed/purposive is a [[property]] of systems that are able to think/reason/infer using [[symbols]].

A system, person, or organization that tends to achieve a [[Objective (goal)|goal]] and demonstrate it in subsequent actions.

To be ''goal-oriented'' is a concept that is included in the [[ontology|ontologies]] of [[systemics]], [[cognitive science]] and [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;(Adam M. Gadomski, 1993,[http://erg4146.casaccia.enea.it/wwwerg26701/Gad-toga.htm TOGA] (Top-down Object-based Goal-oriented Meta-theory )&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Overview ==
The goals that human beings possess can be considered being arranged in a hierarchy, such that higher order goals are more abstract than lower order goals.&lt;ref&gt;(Lord &amp; Levy, 1994, A control theory perspective)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a person may have a goal to become an educated person. To achieve this goal, they may have a goal to get a college degree. To obtain a college degree, they may have the goal to complete a college application, and to complete a college application they may have the goal of reach for a pen. Behavior may also be directed from the bottom up, meaning that lower order goals may briefly shift attention.&lt;ref&gt;(Lord &amp; Levy, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if one smells smoke while reaching for a pen, their new goal may be to investigate the smell of smoke. 

Individuals continuously monitor whether goals have been achieved through a process called [[self-regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;(Austin &amp; Vancouver, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goal Setting Theory ==
Motivation theories attempt to address how individuals react when a discrepancy is perceived between one's goals and the current state of the environment. Several common theories of motivation involve goal directed behavior. The most common of these theories are Goal Setting Theory&lt;ref&gt;(GST; Locke &amp; Latham, 1990; 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of theories referred to as &quot;control theories&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998; Powers, 1973; 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;,and Social Cognitive Theory &lt;ref&gt;(SCT; Bandura, 1986; 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. GST has accumulated a great deal of empirical evidence over the past 35 years &lt;ref&gt;(Locke &amp; Latham, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Essentially, individuals exert more effort and thus achieve higher levels of performance on a task when goals are difficult and specific. However, this is only the case when individuals are committed to the goal, believe they can accomplish the goal, and have the requisite skills&lt;ref&gt;(Locke &amp; Latham, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;. Control theories are centered around reduction of goal/environment discrepancies. 

According to control theories, when an individual perceives a discrepancy between the current state some action is taken to reduce the discrepancy. To reduce a goal/environment disparity, individuals may change their behavior (e.g., exert more effort) or change their goal &lt;ref&gt;(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;). SCT also predicts that individuals will seek to reduce discrepancies between goals and the state of the environment; however, SCT predicts that individuals will set new and more difficult goals when goal/environment discrepancies have be eliminated&lt;ref&gt;(Bandura, 1986, 1997; Bandura &amp; Locke, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;. This goal/environment discrepancy ''production'' is expected to occur only when individuals believe that they will be able to accomplish their goals in the future, a construct known as self-efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;(Bandura, 1986, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Goal orientation ==
Goal orientation is often seen as an aspect of an individual's [[motivation]].  An individual's goal orientation describes the goals that they choose and the methods used to pursue those goals.&lt;ref&gt;(DeShon &amp; Gillespie, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Dweck (1986) noticed that school children seemed to display two distinct patterns of goal oriented behavior. While some children sought tasks that were challenging that they could learn from, other children sought out tasks that were easier, allowing them to either demonstrate their abilities or avoid appearing incompetent. Dweck (1986) and others&lt;ref&gt;(e.g., Ames &amp; Archer, 1988; Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; found that children with an incremental theory of intelligence, that is, children who believed that intelligence was malleable and could be improved through effort, tended to be mastery oriented, seeking challenging assignments. 

Conversely, children with an entity theory of intelligence (believing that intelligence was fixed and not subject to change) tended to be performance oriented, choosing tasks where they could demonstrate their abilities. In the subsequent years since Dweck's papers, goal orientation has become an important motivational construct, not only in the educational literature but in the industrial/organizational psychology literature as well. However, the structure of the construct has not been well defined, with some models containing as few as 1 factor and others containing as many as 6 &lt;ref&gt;(DeShon &amp; Gillespie, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

One of the most common conceptualizations of goal orientation is the three factor model &lt;ref&gt;(e.g., VandeWalle, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. That is, individuals can be described in terms of goal orientation based on three factors: 
* mastery, 
* performance-approach, and 
* performance-avoid. 
Individuals with a mastery goal orientation seek challenging tasks and value learning. Highly performance-approach oriented individuals seek tasks that allow them to demonstrate the skills they already possess, and highly performance-avoidant tend to avoid tasks where they may fail and thus appear incompetent.

==Examples==
* In engineering, an autonomous device can be goal-oriented. (A robotic car that drives from point A to point B, for example.)
* In cognitive science, in the case of a [[sub-symbolic]] reasoning the concept ''goal'' is not &quot;visible&quot;/perceived neither for the reasoning system nor for its observer.
* In [[psychology]], [[socio-cognitive]] research and [[Artificial intelligence]], human rational behaviour is also goal-oriented.
* In [[organization]] sciences, the identification of an intervention goal of an individual and his/her goal-oriented behaviour, is more complex because, in real situation:
** every human usually has more than one goal,
** declared goal can be not congruent with his/her behavior, 
** organization goals can not be the goal of its employers.

==Limitations==
Goal-Orientation has its limitations in situations of [[uncertainty]], when the future is truly unpredictable and probability estimates of future developments cannot be made. In those situations, means-orientation (basing action on ''who I am'', ''what I know'' and ''whom I know'' - maintaining flexibility for desirably outcomes) can outperforms goal-orientation. Expert entrepreneurs, who developed expertise in creating value under uncertainty, prefer means-orientation to goal-orientation using heuristics called [[effectuation]]&lt;ref&gt;Sarasvathy, S. (2008): Effectuation: Elements of Entrepreneurial Expertise (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar.)&lt;/ref&gt;. Effectuation can also be successfully applied in other situations of uncertainty in fields such as [[leadership]], [[innovation]], [[R&amp;D]], [[career development]] or [[self-management]]&lt;ref&gt;Faschingbauer, M. (2010) Effectuation: &quot;Wie erfahrene Unternehmer denken, entscheiden und handeln&quot; Stuttgart: Schäffer-Poeschel&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ambient Assisted Living''' (known as '''AAL''') includes methods, concepts, (electronic) systems, devices as well as services that are providing unobtrusive support for daily life based on context and the situation of the assisted person. The technologies applied for AAL are user-centric, i.e. oriented towards the needs and capabilities of the actual user. They are also integrated into the immediate personal environment of the user. As a consequence, the technology is adapting to the user rather than the other way around. In order to share relevant information between systems and services, technologies for AAL should ideally be based on modular and interoperable concepts. This would also support a “virtual intelligence” of the AAL environment. However, this capacity is not absolutely required. 

The potential users of such technologies are not forming a homogeneous group. They include young and healthy individuals, who are mainly interested in &quot;lifestyle functionalities” in order to improve their individual quality of life. On the other hand, they may include individuals suffering from multiple illnesses, who are interested in maintaining a self-determined life at home. The assistance provided through AAL is not limited to the direct user. Products and services in the AAL environment will also address professional care provides, medical professionals as well as family members by providing better means of communication as well easier social interaction. 

== Rationale and Goals ==
A main driver for the development of AAL technologies is [[Population ageing]]. AAL technologies can be instrumental in tackling the massively increasing cost of healthcare. Another driver is the rising number of single person households in combination with rising expectations towards the quality of life. AAL technologies also cater towards the increasing demand of safety, comfortable living environments as well as the increasing demand for communication and stronger social interaction with others.

== Use Cases and Scenarios ==
Often cited examples cover the areas of security and safety, quality of life and entertainment. This includes the automatic switching off of cooking stoves when leaving home, measures to prevent breaking and entry or the adjusting of room lights, temperature and music to situation specific settings based on the habits of the user. 
 
Most of these systems are self-learning. They are using a network of sensors to combine and analyse data in order to enable the carrying out of routine operations and daily tasks. If it becomes obvious that the user is either in danger or overburdened, such an „intelligent“ system would be able to propose a certain course of action or to contact external service providers (e.g. care or security providers or telemedicine centres). If necessary, an emergency call could also be placed with appropriate bodies.
 
== Acceptance and Criticism ==
The fact that systems based on AAL technologies could act independently on behalf of their users is raising a number of questions, including legal issues. These questions include [[the right to informational self determination|informational self determination]] as well as the protection of personal information. The responsible evaluation of technically available assistance and the required surveillance of individual behaviour and the communication of data will have considerable influence on the acceptance of AAL-based systems and their success on the market. In the long term the acceptance of such systems needs to be at the same level as that of other technologies which are tightly integrated into daily life. One example from the automotive sector would be the [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]]).

== Links to other areas of Research ==
The basis for AAL technologies are advances in [[micro systems technology]]. These have led to a considerable reduction in the size of sensors as well as actors. This is now permitting to include such components into the environment of daily life. In addition, 
AAL is one area for the application of so-called [[Ambient intelligence]], which has been under discussion since the beginning of the 1990s. Ambient Intelligence can be understood as a European answer to the more hardware-based idea of [[ubiquitous computing]]. Strongly related is the concept of [[Smart Living]], which has a strong focus on connecting household appliances rather than developing an integrated environment for services and assistance. 
The IT basis for AAL is the automation of machinery with the help of [[Artificial Intelligence]]. Use cases in the medical environment are strongly related to [[Telemonitoring]].

== Players ==
In 2004, the German Ministry of Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)) has initiated in cooperation with VDI/VDE Innovation + Technik GmbH and other European partners a &quot;Strategic Support Action (SSA)&quot; within the 6th EU Framework Program. This Action had the goal to develop a support program for the then new area of AAL.

A number of research institutes, universities, companies and other bodies is active in research and development of AAL applications. The Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik (VDE) is providing an overview of these activities in the form of short descriptions on the website indicated in the section with weblinks. Since 2008 a new “Partnership for Innovation” on AAL is providing a platform for a „think tank“ consisting of multiple institutions. This partnership is supported by the German Ministry for Research (BMBF) and is hosting a number of working groups dealing with market analysis, business models as well as the task of communicating the benefits of AAL in Germany.

After several years of preparation, the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme (AAL JP) has been started in Europe in summer 2008. Main platform of the AAL JP is the AAL Association in Brussels that has been set up by the representatives of 23 participating countries. Germany is being represented in the AAL Association by BMBF. It is intended to publish two Calls for Proposals per year, each focused on a specific issue related to AAL. The 1st Call has already been published in 2008 under the title &quot;ICT based solutions for Prevention and Management of Chronic Conditions of Elderly People.

In 2006, the consortium „Continua Health Alliance“ (Weblink see below) has been established in the United States of America. Continua is including a number of major companies and is focused on health applications.

[[Image:Nokia N900.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[N900]] is a gadget that was released November 11, 2009.]]

A '''gadget''' is a small&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gadget gadget - Definition from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; technological object (such as a [[tool|device]] or an [[home appliances|appliance]]) that has a particular function, but is often thought of as a [[novelty]].  Gadgets are invariably{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} considered to be more unusually or cleverly designed than normal technological objects at the time of their invention. Gadgets are sometimes also referred to as [[gizmo]]s.

==History==

The origins of the word &quot;gadget&quot; trace back to the 19th century. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], there is anecdotal evidence for the use of &quot;gadget&quot; as a [[placeholder name]] for a technical item whose precise name one can't remember since the 1850s; with Robert Brown's 1886 book ''Spunyarn and Spindrift, A sailor boy’s log of a voyage out and home in a China tea-clipper'' containing the earliest known usage in print.&lt;ref name=&quot;quinion&quot;&gt;[[Michael Quinion]]: ''[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-gad1.htm World Wide Words: Gadget]'' (accessed February 6, 2008) Also in&lt;!--according to http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-01-30-n75.html--&gt;: Michael Quinion: ''Port Out, Starboard Home: The Fascinating Stories We Tell About the Words We Use''. ISBN 978-0141012230&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymology of the word is disputed. A widely circulated story holds that the word gadget was &quot;invented&quot; when Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Cie, the company behind the [[repoussé]] construction of the [[Statue of Liberty]] (1886), made a small-scale version of the monument and named it after their firm; however this contradicts the evidence that the word was already used before in nautical circles, and the fact that it did not become popular, at least in the USA, until after World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;quinion&quot;/&gt; Other sources cite a derivation from the French ''gâchette'' which has been applied to various pieces of a firing mechanism, or the French ''gagée'', a small tool or accessory.&lt;ref name=&quot;quinion&quot;/&gt; The first [[atomic bomb]] was nicknamed ''[[the gadget]]'' by the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]], tested at the [[Trinity site]].

In the book &quot;Above the Battle&quot; by [[Vivian Drake]], published in 1918 by D. Appleton &amp; Co., of New York and London, being the memoirs of a pilot in the British [[Royal Flying Corps]], there is the following passage: &quot;Our ennui was occasionally relieved by new gadgets -- &quot;gadget&quot; is the Flying Corps slang for invention! Some gadgets were good, some comic and some extraordinary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=0n7GCX1NUUIC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22Above+the+Clouds%22+by+Vivian+Drake,#v=onepage&amp;q=gadget&amp;f=false Above the Battle, p.191] at Google Book Search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application gadgets==

Computer programs that provide services without needing an independent application to be launched for each one, but instead run in an environment that manages multiple gadgets. There are several implementations based on existing software development techniques, like [[JavaScript]], form input, and various image formats.

: {{See|Google Desktop|Google Gadgets|Microsoft Gadgets|Dashboard software Apple Widgets}}

The earliest{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} documented use of the term ''gadget'' in context of [[software engineering]] was in [[1985]] by the developers of [[AmigaOS]], the [[operating system]] of the [[Amiga]] computers (''[[Intuition (Amiga)|intuition.library]]'' and also later '''''gad'''tools.library''). It denotes what other technological traditions call ''[[GUI widget]]''—a control element in [[graphical user interface]]. This [[naming convention]] remains in continuing use (as of [[2008]]) since then.

It is not known whether other software companies are explicitly drawing on that inspiration when featuring the word in names of their technologies or simply referring to the generic meaning. The word ''widget'' is older in this context.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Examples of electronic gadgets==
Useful gadgets: Advanced mobile phones e.g. [[N900]], [[GPS navigation device]], [[Key finder]]

Novelty gadgets: [[USB toys]], toy grade [[radio controlled cars]]

The growth of HTA internationally can be seen in the expanding membership of the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), a non-profit umbrella organization established in 1993. Organizations and individuals involved in HTA research are also affiliated with societies such as the international societies HTAI and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). An international masters program in health technology assessment and management, ULYSSES, is also offered.

In the UK, the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre for Healthcare (www.match.ac.uk) Programme carries out HTA in collaboration with the health service, the NHS and various industrial partners.  MATCH is organised into four themes addressing key HTA topics including Health Economics, Tools for Industry, User Needs and Procurement and Supply chain.

'''Health technology''' can be defined broadly as:
{{Quote|Any intervention that may be used to promote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for rehabilitation or long-term care. This includes the pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures and organizational systems used in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment). | title=HTA glossary. | url=http://www.inahta.org/HTA/Glossary/#_Health_technology| date=June 8, 2009 | publisher=INAHTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Applied science''' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science, or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.

Fields of [[engineering]] are closely related to '''applied sciences'''. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D).

Applied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis''' (SHS) is a method for producing substances, materials and items via exothermic autowave reaction. This combustion-like process is ignited by point-heating of a small part (usually the top) of the prepared sample. The heat should be enough for initial burning of surrounding material, which in turn, generates heat that burns the following part of the material, and in this way a wave of exothermic reaction is generated that covers the rest of material. With this method it is possible to obtain various products both inorganic and organic nature with unusual properties, for example powders, metallic alloys, ceramics with high purity, corrosion–resistance at high–temperature or super-hardnessity. 

SHS process was reported in&lt;ref name=Merzhanov&gt;&quot;''Self-propagated high-temperature synthesis of refractory inorganic compounds''&quot;, A.G. Merzhanov, I.P. Borovinskaya. Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, Vol. 204, N 2, pp. 366-369, May, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and patented in Russia in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;USSR Patent No. 255221, Byull. Izobr. No. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Some SHS-like processes are known from far ancienty.

To produce [[combustion]] it is necessary to have both reducers and oxidizers; and thus, in order to maintain a self-propagating combustion the presence of both components and their contact is necessary. 

SHS can be performed in fine powders, thin films, liquids, gases, powder–liquid systems, gas suspensions, layered systems, gas-gas systems, etc. The mixture may burn in vacuum, air or inert or reactive gas.

In case of solids, by reducing the size of the particles, an increase of the surface area is achieved. Current technologies can produce what is called [[Nanocomposite]]s which are multiphase powders of nanometric scale.

A '''product teardown''', or simply '''teardown''', is the act of disassembling a product, such as a television set, to identify its component parts.  The results are typically disseminated through photographs and component lists so that others can make use of the information without having to disassemble the product themselves.

This information can be of interest to hobbyists, but can also used commercially by the technical community to find out, for example, what semiconductor components are being utilized in consumer electronic products, such as the [[Wii]] video game console or[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]].  Such knowledge can aid understanding of how the product works, including innovative design features, and can facilitate estimating the [[bill of materials]].  The financial community therefore has an interest in teardowns, as knowing how a company's products are built can help guide a stock valuation.  Manufacturers are often not allowed to announce what components are present in a product due to non-disclosure agreements.

Identifying semiconductor components in systems has become more difficult over the past years.  The most notable change started with Apple's 8GB iPod nano,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobilehandsetdesignline.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=4VBX5CX5UVWGAQSNDLPCKHSCJUNN2JVN?articleID=193105360&amp;queryText=Tear+Down%3A+Inside+the+Apple+8GB+iPod+nano&lt;/ref&gt; where they took readily available components, such as the Wolfson Microelectonics WM8750&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/products/WM8750&lt;/ref&gt; and repackaged them with Apple branding.  This makes it more difficult to identify the actual device manufacturer and function of the component without performing a '''decap''' – removing the outer packaging to analyze the die within.  Typically there are markings on the die inside the package that can lead experienced engineers to who actually created the device and what functionality it performs in the system.

Teardowns have also been performed in front of a live studio audience at the [[Embedded Systems Conference]].  The first live teardown was performed on a Toyota Prius at the [[Embedded Systems Conference]] in San Jose, April 2006.  Since that time, additional live teardowns have been performed, most recently being the Sony OLED TV, Gibson Self-Tuning Guitar, SuitSat space suit, and Sony Rolly MP3 player.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-egevents.com/web/esv/event-highlights/teardowns&lt;/ref&gt;

There seem to be two major companies that perform teardowns - '''Portelligent''' and '''Semiconductor Insights''', both of which write featured articles in [[EETimes]] and '''TechOnline''' on their findings.  Both companies were acquired by [[TechInsights]], a division of [[United Business Media]] in 2007.  While Semiconductor Insights still remains focused on their other business opportunities, their teardown services, as well as Portelligent, are now part of TechOnline, which is a subgroup of United Business Media's TechInsights division.  There also appear to be three main authors from these companies that write the articles.  David Carey, President for Portelligent, Jeff Brown, Senior Analyst for Portelligent, and Gregory A. Quirk, Technical Marketing Manager for TechOnline.

'''&quot;Why the future doesn't need us&quot;''' is an article written by [[Bill Joy]] (then Chief Scientist at [[Sun Microsystems]]) in the April 2000 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine. In the article, he argues (quoting the sub title) that &quot;Our most powerful 21st-century technologies &amp;mdash; [[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] &amp;mdash; are threatening to make humans an [[endangered species]].&quot; Joy warns:

:&quot;The experiences of the [[History of nuclear weapons|atomic scientists]] clearly show the need to take personal responsibility, the danger that things will move too fast, and the way in which a process can take on a life of its own. We can, as they did, create insurmountable problems in almost no time flat. We must do more thinking up front if we are not to be similarly surprised and shocked by the consequences of our inventions.&quot;

The essay has been compared by ''[[The Times]]'' to [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|1939 letter]] to then-US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], warning him of the possibility of the [[Nazis]] inventing the [[Atomic Bomb|atomic bomb]]. While some critics  have characterized Joy's stance as [[obscurantism]] or [[neo-Luddism]], others share his concerns about the consequences of rapidly expanding technology.&lt;ref&gt;Khushf, George (2004). &quot;The Ethics of Nanotechnology: Vision and Values for a New Generation of Science and Engineering&quot;, in ''Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering'', by National Academy of Engineering, pp. 31–32. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. ISBN 030909271X.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Criticisms==

In Ray Kurzweil's ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', he questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking &quot;Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?&quot;.  However, some authors, such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Chellis Glendinning]], believe that modern technologies are bad for both freedom and the problem of cancer, and that the two issues are connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatailsus.htm |title=What Ails Us? |publisher=Insurgentdesire.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/age-of-grief.htm |title=Age of Grief |publisher=Primitivism.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/health-civilization.htm |title=Health and the Rise of Civilization |publisher=Primitivism.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that cancer was used by Kurzweil merely as an example of a group that stood to benefit from advancing technology; it's irrelevant if cancer is in fact caused by modern civilization, which is what [[John Zerzan]] and [[Chellis Glendinning]] were arguing for.

In the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 article titled ''A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists'', Bill Joy was criticized for having technological tunnel vision on his prediction, by failing to consider social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and- Gloom Technofuturists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.

In the 15th Anniversary issue of Wired Magazine in 2008, Lucas Graves's article reported that the genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics technologies have not reached the level that would make Bill Joy's scenario come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graves |first=Lucas |url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/16-04/st_15joy |title=15th Anniversary: Why the Future Still Needs Us a While Longer |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Information and Media Literacy''' ('''IML''') is one of the essential capacities that enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right&lt;ref name=&quot;portal.unesco.org&quot;&gt;http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of [[Information Literacy]] has been research skills&lt;ref&gt;http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[Media Literacy]], a study that emerges around [[1970s]] traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays, the study of Information Literacy has been extended to include the study of Media Literacy in many countries like UK &lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;, Australia and New Zealand &lt;ref&gt;http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  The term Information and Media Literacy is used by [[UNESCO]] &lt;ref name=&quot;portal.unesco.org&quot;/&gt; to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of Information Literacy.  It is also defined as Information and Communication Technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in the United States&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  Educators, such as [[Gregory Ulmer]], has also defined the field as [[electracy]].

IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically.  It is important to have capacity to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.

==Twenty-First century students==
The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st Century literate.  According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), “technology has everything to do with literacy.  And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate.”  &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm Literacy by Design:  Why is all This Technology so Important?] &lt;/ref&gt; He supports his argument with J. David Bolter’s statement “that if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate.  They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context”. (Wilhelm, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;4)

Wilhelm's statement is supported by a the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada &lt;ref&gt;http://www.media-awareness.ca&lt;/ref&gt; on 5000 Grade 4 - 11 students&lt;ref&gt;http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;.  The key findings of the survey are:
*62% of Grade 4 students prefer the Internet
*38% of Grade 4 students choose the library.
*91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet,
*9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library (YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28).

Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term ''[[digital native]]'' to describe the individuals, who have been brought up in a digital world&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Internet]] has been a pervasive element of young people’s home lives. Ninety-four percent of kids report that they have Internet access at home, and a significant majority of them (61 percent) enjoy a high-speed connection.  By the time kids hit Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer (YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;6).  The survey has also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. But contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today’s wired kid is a social kid (YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents. Teachers and parents may not understand the abilities of technology.   Students are no longer limited to the desktop computer. Students use mobile technologies to graph a mathematical problem, research a question for Social Studies, text message an expert for information as well as send homework to a drop box&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~b4poppen/IPhoneArticle3.doc&lt;/ref&gt;.   Students are accessing information by using [[MSN (disambiguation)|MSN]], personal Web pages, [[Weblog]]s and [[social network service|social networking sites]].

==Teaching and learning in the 21st century ==
Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching the way from the past 50 years.  Traditionally teachers have been the experts downloading their knowledge to the open minds of children.  Technology and the learning tools it provides access to forces us to change to being facilitators of learning.  We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information and students as consumers of information in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of Digital Natives.

Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information.  Digital Natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices.  People born prior to 1988 are generally referred to as Digital Immigrants.  They speak with accents and experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR.  Digital Immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work. 

Learning a language is best done early in a child’s development. 

In acquiring a [second language], Hyltenstam (1992, as cited in Wikipedia, 2007) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency.  After that age, [second language] learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the [first language] group (para. 4).

Kindergarten, Grade 1 and 2 are critical to student success as Digital Natives because not all students have “Digital” rich childhood.  Students learning “Digital” before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. “Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power.”  (August, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1)  Speaking “Digital” is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in society and have full options to life’s opportunities within North America.

When teachers are aware of the IML capacities that are needed to grow in students, they are seeking to meet the diverse learning needs of students. Twenty-first Century classrooms could look like this: read an email from [[Flat Stanley]], a fictional character, look up the weather channel, synchronize calendar time with another class via webcam, practice math concepts at home with virtual manipulative, and use digital microscopes to meet the Kindergarten science PLO to “describe properties of materials, including colour, shape, texture, size and weight.”  (BC MoE, 2005a, p 27)

Another '''free''' resource for students, is the online story of '''Inanimate Alice'''. Alice grows up in this new age and the episodes combine music, images and text to stimulate the imagination and involve the learner in her digital world. [http://www.inanimatealice.com]

==Student's struggle with Media and Information Literacy==
Many students are considered illiterate in media and information because of various reaons.  They may not see the value media and information literacy in the 21st century classroom.  Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information.  Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate.  Very little changes would be made if the educators are not supporting Information and Media Literacy in their own classrooms.

Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available.  Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established.  Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.  

When [the staff] and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved  (Lambert, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;6). Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.

The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met.  After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:

#What does each student need to learn?
#How does one know whether students have met the capacities?
#How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning? 

Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support.  Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.

==Information and Media Literacy in the Curriculum==
This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].  In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology (November, 2006).  International Society for Technology in Education  (''[[ISTE]]'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ISTE&lt;/ref&gt; has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the [[National Educational Technology Standards]] ('[http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=NETS NETS]')&lt;ref&gt;http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an [http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/ Information Literacy website] developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.

===US===
IML has been included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education&lt;ref&gt;http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120&lt;/ref&gt;. Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin &lt;ref&gt;http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual school district, such as the Clarkstown Central School District &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; has also developed its own information literacy curriculum.  [[ISTE]] - The International Society for Technology in Education has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Educational_Technology_Standards&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[British Columbia]] (BC) of [[Canada]], its [http://www.gov.bc.ca/bced/ Ministry of Education] has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996) &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/resdocs/itk7.pdf Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996)] &lt;/ref&gt; as a stand-alone course.  It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes (PLOs) continue to be integrated.   

This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].   In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology (November, 2006).  Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.

The BC Ministry of Education published The Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/perf_stands/icti/ Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005)] &lt;/ref&gt;  These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.

===Asia===
In Singapore &lt;ref&gt; http://www.moe.gov.sg/edumall/mpite/overview/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Hong Kong &lt;ref&gt;http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2004/en/07_07.htm &lt;/ref&gt;, Information Literacy or Information Technology was listed as a formal curriculum.

==Barriers to information and media literacy==

The barrier to learning to read is the lack of textbooks and novels while the barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access.  Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within the school infrastructure, the staff development, and the support systems.  While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle will be school climate.  

Marc Prensky (2006, para. 25) identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions by stating, “Let’s admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would ‘vote with their feet’ by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling.”

The mindset of banning new technology, fearing all bad things that can and sometimes do happen can affect educational decisions.  The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.  

Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe.  Safety lessons are mandatory in Industrial Technology and Science.  Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology. 

Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs.  One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools.  Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions.  Many barriers to IML exist and we need to remove them.

'''[[Technology]]''' in '''[[science fiction]]''' has helped create many common topics found in science fiction today.  There have been authors who have taken innovations and have elaborated and created what they thought future [[technology]] would be and how it would be used.  Today, new technology has brought about new theories and questions that authors have tried to explain in their writings.  Due to the new breakthroughs in technology, [[Science Fiction]] has been able to create new genres for these discoveries and have allowed Science Fiction authors their own expansion on these new ideas.

==Space Warp/Hyper Space/Star Drive==
===Early writers to mention this topic===
E.E. “Doc” Smith: Skylark  and Lensman series (1920’s)

Science Fiction magazines: [[Astounding Science Fiction]] and [[Amazing Stories]] (1930’s to 1950’s)

Definition of terms in Doc’s SF about this topic:

Interstellar Travel: ships being “inertia-less”; inertia-less state makes travel effortless at huge multiples of the speed of light

===Other Terms Used Commonly===
Hyper Space: where infinite speeds are possible; a ship may jump to [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyper space]] or [[star drive]] “clutching at the very fabric of time itself” thus making travel that would normally take thousands of years possible in no time at all

===Timeline of Probable Influences===

[[File:Ksc-69pc-442.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Saturn V]] carrying ''Apollo 11'' took several seconds to clear the tower on July 16, 1969. Provided by [[Apollo 11]]]]

1903 - The [[Wright brothers]] invented the first gas motored and manned airplane, thus making human flight in any sense, possible

1920’s - [[Robert Goddard]]’s development of liquid fueled rockets, later developed to be used as the [[V-2 rocket|V2]] in [[World War II]]; long range sub-orbital rockets consuming either solid or liquid fuel that carried warheads (Was the first rocket the beginning idea of the space rocket?)

'''Early Era Space Exploration:'''

[[Space Race]] between the US and Soviet Union to reach the moon 

The launch of the first man-made object to orbit Earth; [[USSR]]’s [[Sputnik 1]] (October 4, 1957)

[[Soviet Union]] putting first man in space; Yuri Gagarin aboard [[Vostok 1]] (1961)

First moon landing by America; [[Apollo 11]] (July 20, 1969)

First space station; [[Salyut 1]]

===Summary===

With new developments in space exploration and technology the idea of space exploration became a reality.  Though many writer’s explored space travel before these events and inventions, the reality of new technologies and the evidence that space exploration was now possible opened new doors to create more fantastical ideas of space travel.  Many Science Fiction topics are born from reality, but turn these new technologies to create imagined realities, thus creating Science Fiction in itself.

==Mechanical life/ androids/ robots==

===Definitions===

'''[[Artificial Intelligence]]'''
(also known as machine intelligence and often abbreviated as AI) is intelligence exhibited by any manufactured (i.e.) system. The term is often applied to general-purpose computers and also in the field of scientific investigation into the theory and practical application of AI.

'''A [[robot]]''' is an electro-mechanical or bio-mechanical device or group of devices that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks.

'''An [[android]]''' is a robot made to resemble a human, usually both in appearance and behavior. The word derives from the Greek andr-, &quot; meaning &quot;man, male&quot;, and the suffix -eides, used to mean &quot;of the species; alike&quot; (from eidos &quot;species&quot;).

'''A [[cyborg]]''' is a cybernetic organism which adds to or enhances its abilities by using technology.
Other terms used commonly.

'''Machine Intelligence''', which is derived up from [[Artificial Intelligence]] as you see in the definition above.
How could development of technology over the decades help these different ideas in science fiction?

===Early timeline of probable influences===

*1957: [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] AIS begins with focus on learning machines and self-organizing systems.

*1961: MINOS 1 First perceptron machine, responds to a pattern of binary inputs using weights.

*1966: Artificial Intelligence Center is formed

*1966-1972: [[Shakey the Robot]] First autonomous mobile robots, controlled from radio and TV links.

*1968: A* Algorithm Graph-searching algorithm used to route planning solver for navigation.

*1969: [[STRIPS]] Planning engine for Shakey.

*1969: QA3 and QA4 Automated problem solving.

===Summary===
With these developments of Technology through machine engineering and companies that are fully devoted in making the technology, Authors have taken a great interest in this genre or Science Fiction to include technology and have their ideas that are derived from the influences of engineering companies as well as their own imaginations of their creations through technology. The technology that has been created over time has given writers as well as other forms of art the inspiration to create non-human characters.

==ESP/Psychic Powers/Psi Phenomena==
===Terms Commonly Used===

[[Telepathy]]: the ability to read minds

[[Precognition]]: the ability to see the future

[[Telekinesis]]: the ability to move objects with mental force (Psychokinesis (PK for short) or &quot;mind over matter&quot;)

[[Teleportation]]: the ability to move oneself from one place to the other, or back and forward in time

Telempathy: Emotion-reading 

[[Remote Viewing]]/[[Clairvoyance]]/[[Scrying]]: the ability for seeing things not actually before your eyes

[[Psychometry (paranormal)|Psychometry]]: the ability to sense what has touched a certain physical object or the imprint it has left behind

[[Bilocation]]: the ability to be in two places at the same time.

===Brief History of Psi Phenomena in Science===

While [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] and belief in other powers were, in the beginning, mainly fueled by [[superstitions]], [[religion]] and tradition, the dawn of [[science]] brought about a way to analyze and study these supposed “powers” giving them an anchor in reality.  The [[Scientific Revolution]] featured ideas that life should be “lead by reason” and that, “the universe as a mechanistic, deterministic system could eventually be known accurately and fully through observation and reason”.  While new science and technology gave rise to skepticism towards the existence of [[psi phenomena]], it also gave way for new technologies to be applied in either proving or disproving such phenomena.  One of the first experimental approaches to Psi Phenomena started in the 1930’s and was conducted under the direction of [[J.B. Rhine]] (1895-1980).  Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of card guessing and dice rolling experiments in a laboratory in attempt to find statistical validation for ESP.  In 1957 the [[Parapsychological Association]] was formed at the preeminent society for [[parapsychology]].  Openness to new parapsychology studies and occult phenomena continued to rise in the 1970’s.

===Technological Developments===

The [[Random Number Generator]]

Ganzfeld Experiment: homogenous, unpatterened, sensory stimulation to produce an effect similar to sensory deprivation

Development of statistical tools by R.A Fisher in the 1920’s

===Timeline of Probable Influences===

E. Dawson Rogers hopes to gain new respectability for [[spiritualism]] and founds [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1882

Government investigations in to parapsychology: [[Project Star Gate]], formed in 1970 with cooperation from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], investigates remote viewing

===Summary===

With new developments in science and technology helping to study and promote parapsychology or Psi Phenomena, many SF writers felt the need to incorporate and elaborate on these subjects in their stories.  While technology helped the investigation into Psi Phenomena it also created questions that many SF writers chose to answer, through their stories, in their own unique way.  If we look at some of the examples of Psi Phenomena prominent in stories, they may have stemmed from how science would take this experimentation with Psi Phenomena and use it.  In Stephen King’s “The Dead Zone”, we see how precognition was used to effect political candidates.  The idea that someone could harness this power and use it for good or evil was one that many SF writer’s elaborated on.  In “The Foreign Hand Tie” by Randall Garret espionage takes on a new form via telepathy through twins.  When science and technology can be used to anchor something in reality, via experimentation or exploration, and yield results, it creates controversy that society may fear or even fantasize about.  Throughout SF history, Psi Phenomena can be seen to be used for good and evil, and through new science and technological discoveries, this genre then becomes more real and more elaborate.

==Visitors from other planets==
===Early Writers===

''[[Martians, Go Home]]'' by [[Fredric Brown]], 1956

''The Moon that Vanished'' by [[Leigh Brackett]], 1950

''3 From Out There'' by [[Leo Margulies]], 1959

''[[To Outrun Doomsday]]'' by [[Kenneth Bulmer]], 1957

''Venus Stories'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], 1955

===Definition===

This topic in [[Science Fiction]] is one of the most familiar ones. As soon as scientists realized that life is a natural phenomenon, people started to question whether there was life on other planets. Although there isn’t extensive proof that there is life on other planets, people started writing novels about it and it sparked a curiosity in people.Some of these novels were about friendly visits from the visitors where they got along with humans. Other novels showed a different side, where these beings would be warlike and wanted to conquer everything around them. It is well documented that the first UFO sighting was in 1561 in Germany.No one can ever know for sure what the object was back then, but it just shows how people were curious about the unknown. Although this was the first documentation of this, people didn’t coin the term, flying saucer until 1950. The 1950s is when a string of science fiction novels on this subject came out and also when technology started to boom. 

===Other Terms===

[[UFO]]: Unidetified Flying Object

Flying Saucer: A certain kind of space ship

===Timeline of Probable Influences of Technology===

*''1951'': The first direct-dial transcontinental telephone call was made

*''1951'': The largest television broadcast was made when President Harry Truman made a speech to 30 million people

*''1954'': The solar cell was invented, first solar battery

*''1956'': First Transoceanic telephone cables were formed

*''1958'': The laser was invented

*1967: U.S. physicist [[John Wheeler]] invents the name &quot;[[black hole]]&quot; to describe singularities in space and time.

===Summary===

The notion of parallel worlds have always intrigued different types of genres, especially the Science Fiction aspect. Many authors have toiled with the idea of travelling back in to prehistoric times or traveling forwards to an unknown universe. The idea of entering a world that has not been touched or entering a world that has evolved into a new incomprehnsible parallel, makes people ponder about what it could looks like or what it could be. Authors have used this notion of an alternate reality and have created their own worlds that have given readers a different view of alternate worlds.

== Invisibility ==
 

===Mythology and folklore precursors===

Many myths and legends include [[gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[angels]], and [[demons]] that are often invisible or can choose to become invisible at will.

*One of the first stories to explore the idea of invisibility was in [[Plato]]’s ''[[The Republic]]''. A peasant finds a ring in the tomb of a dead king that allows him to become invisible. He enters the palace, seduces the queen, and plots to kill the present king, showing that power such as invisibility corrupts.
*[[Perseus]], the Greek mythic hero who helped establish the Twelve Olympians, was equipped with a [[cap of invisibility]] to kill [[Medusa]].

===Early writers===

*[[H. G. Wells]] wrote ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897) which was the first science fiction novel to explore the idea of invisibility. The invisible man is a scientist named Griffin who theorizes that if a person’s [[refractive index]] is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, leading to mental instability.

*[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series which revolves around the function of a ring that renders the user invisible. Unfortunately, it had an evil influence with negative effects on the wearer's actions.

*[[Douglas Adams]] wrote ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (1978) novels which encompass a humorous concept of a field which makes people believe the object in question is &quot;somebody else's problem&quot; and therefore do not see it. This concept as explained in the book, bases off of a statement to the effect that actual invisibility is impossible and that the field is merely a way to make something close to being invisible by actually making it hard to notice deliberately. 

*[[Philip K. Dick]] wrote in his 1974 novel A ''[[Scanner Darkly]]'' of a &quot;scramble suit.&quot; This is a flexible sheath covering the body of the wearer with a reflective/refractive coating on the inside surface that transfers the camouflaging pattern- projected by a [[holographic lens]] mounted on the wearer's head- onto the outside surface of the sheath causing a camouflage-like invisibility.

===Definition===
[[Invisibility]] is a term that is usually used as a fantasy or science fiction term where objects are literally made unseeable by magical or technological means.
 
===Invisibility in Science Fiction===
There is an undeniable link between science fact and the ideas that emerge in science fiction. Science fiction authors are inspired by actual scientific and technological discoveries, but allow themselves the freedom to project the possible future course of these discoveries and their potential impact on society, perhaps only weakly bound to the facts.      

===Invisibility in Fiction===
Authors are faced with obstacles presented by the realities of actual technology, however fiction allows a window for the opportunity of inventing completely imaginary technologies to move their storyline forward and maybe even still explore the outcomes of such power. 

*Magic objects such as rings and cloaks can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility. 
*Spells and potions can be used or cast upon people or objects granting temporary invisibility.

===Timeline of possible influences===

*1600's the refractive index was developed. Major advances near the end of the 1800s raised author's awareness

*1670's Emitting or reflecting [[light]] outside the [[wavelength]] range of [[visible light]] would result in a human-shaped [[black hole]] which would be completely opaque.

*1930s [[Chroma key]] began to develop which is the removal of color from one image to reveal another image &quot;behind it.&quot; The removed color becomes transparent, which is also called &quot;color keying.&quot; 

*1938 [[Stealth technology]] began to develop. It is used with aircraft, ships, and missiles, in order to make them less visible to certain detection methods.
 
*2006 In some science fiction stories, a hypothetical &quot;cloaking device&quot; is used to make objects invisible. A team effort of researchers from Britain and the U.S announced the development of a real [[cloak of invisibility]], though it is only in its first stages.

===Summary===

The idea of being unseen and hence undetectable has fascinated mankind for generations. This concept has generated scientific pursuit towards defying our physical parameters. Many authors have toyed with the idea of gaining invisibility via both science-based and fictional means.  Invisibility in the actual scientific world will be a very difficult achievement, one that will involve much more complication than we have begun to delve into. Further technological developments bring us closer to our goal, while also broadening the horizon for science fiction authors performing thought experiments on the topic of invisibility.

'''Service lifecycle management''' (SLM) is defined by industry analyst firm [[AMR Research]] and described as a holistic approach which helps service organizations better understand the revenue potential by looking at service opportunities proactively as a lifecycle rather than a single event or series of discrete events, combining all service-based operations into a single, albeit complex, set of workflows and connected business processes. SLM consists of the following key components:

* [[Workforce management]]
* [[Parts forecasting and planning]]
* [[Knowledge management]]
* [[Enterprise asset management]]
* [[Contract management]]
* [[Returns and repair management]]
* [[Reverse logistics]]

== Distinction from Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) ==
'''Service lifecycle management''' differs from [[Product lifecycle management|Product Lifecycle Management]], or [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]], as it handles the &quot;storage, manipulation, and rendering of electronic data&quot; that manages business service instead of business product. Previously, software solutions for PLM and consultants viewed service as a product; however, SLM's distinction came into play once new [[internet browser|browser]] technologies became heavily integrated with customer relations and service based tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plmic.com/slm-service-lifecycle-management/slm-service-lifecycle-management.aspx A Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) Definition.] www.plmic.com. Retrieved 2009-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for SLM ==
* Post-sale service represents a source of significant and sustained shareholder value
* Service drives customer satisfaction: those with higher customer satisfaction scores substantially outperformed the average S&amp;P stock returns—while delivering less volatility and greater cash flows&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aberdeen.com/summary/report/benchmark/RA_IndustryTraction_MV_2498.asp AberdeenGroup’s Industry Traction of Strategic Service Management], December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* Leading service organizations have enjoyed nearly a 16% increase in [[net client value]] over a two year time frame&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aberdeen.com/summary/report/research_briefs/4747-RB-clevel-view-of-service.asp Report: C-Level View of Service], AberdeenGroup,  December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Service level agreement]]s (SLAs) are becoming more prevalent, and meeting and exceeding them is integral to profitability

== Best practices ==
* Base the solution on a single leading-edge technology platform which seeks to optimize all service-based operations
* Leverage current technology, inventory, sourcing and staffing investments by utilizing a practical solution that is straightforward in implementation but yet flexible enough to handle a variety of service models
* Address process deficiencies before deploying technology
* Define requirements and success criteria clearly before evaluating technology solutions
* Leverage partnerships with service and logistics providers
* Attack aftermarket service as a top-line business opportunity
* Adopt a two-pronged approach to measuring the efficacy of aftermarket service: operational and strategic
* Adopt an enterprise-wide perspective

== Results from SLM deployments{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  ==

* Parts inventory reductions up to 40%
* Returns and repair turnaround time decreases up to 30%
* Warranty entitlements performance improvements up to 15%
* Pricing improvements which lead to gross profit increases up to 15%
* Increase technician “calls per day” volume by 25%
* Call center productivity improvements up to 40%

'''Privacy enhancing technologies''' (PET) is a general term for a set of computer tools, applications and mechanisms which - when integrated in online services or applications, or when used in conjunction with such services or applications - allow [[User (computing)|online users]] to protect the [[data privacy|privacy]] of their [[personally identifiable information]] (PII) provided to and handled by such services or applications.

Privacy enhancing technologies can also be defined as:
: ''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies is a system of ICT measures protecting informational privacy by eliminating or minimising personal data thereby preventing unnecessary or unwanted processing of personal data, without the  loss of the functionality of the information system.''
: {{Harv|van Blarkom|Borking|Olk|2003}}

==Goals of PETs==
PETs aim at allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers, merchants or other users:
* increase '''control''' over their personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers and merchants (or other online users) ([[Informational self-determination|self-determination]])
* '''data minimisation''': minimise the personal data collected and used by service providers and merchants
* choose the degree of '''anonymity''' (e.g. by using pseudonyms, anonymisers or anonymous data credentials)
* choose the degree of '''unlinkability''' (e.g. by using multiple virtual identities)
* achieve '''informed consent''' about giving their personal data to online service providers and merchants
* provide the possibility to '''negotiate the terms and conditions''' of giving their personal data to online service providers and merchants (data handling/privacy policy negotiation).&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision/ Vision on privacy enchanced identity management]&lt;/ref&gt; In Privacy Negotiations, consumers and service providers establish, maintain, and refine privacy policies as individualised agreements through the ongoing choice amongst service alternatives. In incentivised privacy negotiations, the transaction partners may additionally bundle the personal information collection and processing schemes with monetary or non-monetary rewards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy-negotiations.de Key Facts on Privacy Negotiations]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* provide the possibility to have these negotiated terms and conditions '''technically enforced''' by the infrastructures of online service providers and merchants (i.e. not just having to rely on promises, but being confident that it is technically impossible for service providers to violate the agreed upon data handling conditions)
* provide the possibility to '''remotely audit the enforcement''' of these terms and conditions at the online service providers and merchants (assurance)
* '''data tracking''': allow users to log, archive and look up past transfers of their personal data, including what data has been transferred, when, to whom and under what conditions
* facilitate the '''use of their legal rights''' of data inspection, correction and deletion

==Existing PETs ==
Examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are:
* [[Anonymizer|'''Communication anonymizers''']] hiding the real online identity (email address, IP address, etc.) and replacing it with a non-traceable identity (disposable / one-time email address, random IP address of hosts participating in an anonymising network, pseudonym, etc.). They can be applied to email, Web browsing, P2P networking, VoIP, Chat, instant messaging, etc. 
* '''Shared bogus online accounts'''. One person creates an account for MSN, providing bogus data for Name, address, phone number, preferences, life situation etc. They then publish their user-ID and password on the Internet. Everybody can now use this account comfortably. Thereby the user is sure that there is no personal data about him in the account profile. (Moreover, he is freed from the hassle of having to register at the site himself.)
* '''Access to personal data''': The service provider's infrastructure allows users to inspect, correct or delete all their data stored at the service provider.

==Future PETs==
Examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed are:&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf White Paper] (Version 2)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wallets of multiple [[virtual identities]]'''; ideally unlinkable. Such wallets allow the efficient and easy creation, management and usage of virtual identities. 
* '''Anonymous credentials''': asserted properties/attributes or rights of the holder of the [[credential]] that don't reveal the real identity of the holder and that only reveal so much information as the holder of the credential is willing to disclose. The assertion can be issued by the user herself, by the provider of the online service or by a third party (another service provider, a government agency, etc.). For example:
** '''Online car rental'''. The car rental agency doesn't really need to know the true identity of the customer. It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23 (as an example), that the customer has a driving licence, that the customer has health insurance for accidents (as an example), and that the customer is paying. Thus no real need to know her real name nor her address nor any other [[personal information]]. Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable: they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service (data minimisation), and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money. When ordering a car online, the user, instead of providing the classical name, address and [[credit card number]], provides the following credentials, all issued to [[pseudonym]]s, i.e. not to the real name of the customer:
*** An assertion of minimal age, issued by the state, proving that the holder is older than 23 (i.e. the actual age is not provided)
*** A [[driving licence]], i.e. an assertion, issued by the motor vehicle control agency, that the holder is entitled to drive cars
*** A [[proof of insurance]], issued by the health insurance
*** Digital cash
:With this data, the car rental agency is in possession of all the data it needs to rent the car, it can thus, as an example, provide the unlocking code to the customer with which she can unlock the closet where the car key is kept. 
: Similar scenarios are buying wine at an Internet wine store or renting a movie at an online movie rental store.

* '''Negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions'''. Before ordering a product or service online, the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider. This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data, such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties (profile selling) and under what conditions (e.g. only while informing the user), or at what time in the future it shall be deleted (if at all). As an example, it can be negotiated that personal data mustn't be handed out to third parties or that the data is to be deleted after 3 months following the end of the contract. While this negotiation takes place, the online service provider communicates his requirements about the minimum amount of data he needs to provide the wanted service. Additional personal data may be asked for, too, but will be clearly labelled as optional. After the transfer of personal data took place, the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider, which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations. Moreover, this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user, for example by verifying chains of certification based on [[Trusted computing]] modules or by verifying privacy seals/labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations (e.g. data protection agencies). Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse [[personal data]], users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions. 

* '''Data transaction log'''. Users can log what personal data they sent to which service provider, when and under what conditions. These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom, or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider. This leads to more [[transparency]], which is a pre-requisite of being in control.

==The business case for PETs ==
Companies will usually only invest in technologies enhancing the privacy of their customers if they see a financial benefit, i.e. if they anticipate a positive [[business case]]. (The other main reason being to comply with legal requirements (which could be considered as coming down to a 'financial benefit' as well; the benefit of avoiding a fine for non-compliance with the [[law]].)) The anticipated financial benefit is the anticipated increase of income due to privacy enhancing technologies, minus the anticipated increased cost of implementing and running privacy enhanced technologies in their infrastructure. This anticipated comparison is usually done over a couple of years, whereby the income and cost of every year is cumulated. 

In other words, if the anticipated additional income cumulated over a couple of years is larger than the anticipated additional cost cumulated over the same number of years, then there is a positive business case and it makes sense for the company to consider implementing and deploying the privacy enchanced technologies in question.

Note that the business case outlined here is a 'differential business case', assuming that privacy functions are added to an existing service and taking into account the additional benefits and costs caused by this added functionality. For example, it would be wrong to account all operational costs, including those that were there before the privacy enhancing functions were added. Instead, only the additional costs incurring when operating the infrastructure with implemented privacy enhancements must be counted in. If, however, the service in consideration is a pure privacy enhancing service, i.e. if the privacy enhancement is not part of or added to the service but instead is the only component of the service, then the business cost and benefit factors below become absolute (delete &quot;additional&quot; and &quot;increased&quot; in all benefits and cost components). 

===Cost components===
The anticipated additional cost components for an online service due to enhancing it with privacy protecting technologies are:
* additional hardware
* additional [[software licences]]
* personnel costs for designing, developing, implementing, testing and deploying the privacy enhanced service (project costs) 
* additional personnel costs for 
** running / operating and maintaining the privacy enhanced service (with respect to what it would be if there were no such privacy enhancements)
** fixing additional system failures or problems due to increased [[system complexity]] (more functionality means higher complexity which leads to higher vulnerability) 
** product management of the additional privacy enhancing functions (more functions require more time spent to manage them)
** more complex new developments of the infrastructure used to run the service
** training customer support and supporting customers
* additional marketing communications costs
* loss of income as a consequence of additional service downtimes or problems due to increased service / system complexity

===Benefit components===
The anticipated additional income for an online service due to enhancing it with privacy protecting technologies divide up into the following components:
* Increased usage of online services by existing customers and increased number of new customers due to 
** fulfilment of the need for privacy of customers (Some customers may only use the service if their privacy needs are fulfilled, other may use the service more often.)
** higher trust of customers in the service
** increased public image and trust (especially if the privacy friendly attitude is advertised)
** competitive advantage (if the competition doesn't have a similar offer)
* increased customer retention (Customers appreciate the privacy enhancing functions of the service and don't like the idea of not finding them with competing services.)
* lower the risk of being fined for violating legal data protection requirements

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Unreferenced|date=March 2007}}
==Definition of the concept==

The '''technological revival''' concept, which can also be called technological reminiscence, consists in using the [[technology]] of today to bring back to life the technological contents of yesterday.

==Applicability of the technological revival concept==

The technological revival concept lies within the idea of a certain nostalgia of the [[multimedia]] contents of yesterday (Radio, television, video games...) It expresses itself fully with the rising coming of Web 2.0. It can take various forms: 

* To use the [[high-tech]] possibilities to make rebirth radiophonic or televisual programs of yesterday. The Internet high flow authorizes,now, this practice on a general basis. As a matter of fact, the vintage multimedias contents are relatively easy to [[digitizing|digitize]], so that they can, then, being downloaded (NB: respect of the royalties) 

EX: Setting on line on [[Internet]], some old television programs. 

* To connect a technological system of yesterday with a system of today. 

EX: To connect a video game console of the 1&lt;small&gt;st&lt;/small&gt; generation (Standard [[Nintendo]] Nes 8 bytes) on a video projector, a plasma screen...

==Technical terms related to the technological revival==

VHS RIP: Televisual program setted on line at the disposal of the Net surfers and whose native source of recording comes from the VHS standard (analogical) 

Radio RIP: Radiophonic program setted on line at the disposal of the Net surfers and whose native source of recording comes from a radio set. 

==Limits of application ==

The technological revival works rather well with [[multimedia]]  contents dating from the 90's, 80's or 70's. Beyond that, it becomes difficult to combine revival technological and quality.

[[Image:Tecnology Life Cycle.png|right|frame|The typical life-cycle of a manufacturing process or production system from the stages of its initial conception to its culmination as either a technique or procedure of common practice or to its demise. The Y-axis of the diagram shows the business gain to the proprietor of the technology while the X-axis traces its lifetime.]]

The '''Technology Life Cycle''' (TLC) describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase, and the financial return during its &quot;vital life&quot;. Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) whilst in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from  Product Life  Cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[Product Life Cycle Management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the market-place in respect of timing of introduction, marketing measures and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (such as, for example, that of a uniquely flavored tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different.

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]] seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The 'product' of the technology may just be a commodity such as the polyethylene plastic or a sophisticated product like the ICs used in a smartphone.

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of patent rights through litigation, or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce its lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the 'management' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Technological_innovation&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Four Phases of the Technology Life Cycle==

The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:

::(a) the '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the &quot;bleeding edge&quot;) when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
::(b) the '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the &quot;leading edge&quot;) 
::(c) the '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region , going into saturation, marked by M, and 
::(d) the '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

==Licensing Options==

In current world trends,  with TLCs shortening due to competition and rapid innovation, a  technology becomes technically licensable at all points of the TLC, whereas earlier, it was licensed only when it was past its maturity  stage.

Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later. 

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===

There are always smaller firms ([[SME]]s) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats.

Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.  

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] ('angels'), can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Large firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s - strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change. 

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stockmarket for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[IPO|Initial Public Offering]] (IPO) which invite risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-alloted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pusuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the Ascent Phase ===

The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the Maturity Phase===

The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to a third-parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity. 

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[Joint Venture|joint-venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the Decline Phase===

After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply,say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria viz. [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations. 

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology. 

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

'''Web Co-operatives''' are a modern variant on the Co-operative Business approach that utilise the instant voting capabilities of the Web to enable members to make collective business decisions.

Although by its very nature the definition of a Web Co-operative is an ever changing entity, Liveline.coop the founders of the Web Co-operative Foundation, decreed a constitution, by which all legitimate Web-Coops must abide, to ensure that the spirit of the Foundation is always maintained. 

==Web Co-operative Constitution==
# Every major business decision must be put to vote
# The number of users must never be limited
# Every user must vote to maintain the right
# &gt;25% of profits must always go to charity
# Funding is to be entirely by donations and sponsorship4

The first Web-Co-operative was set up in January 2007.  It is called Liveline.TV and is a Digital Media Channel.  The Company was set up with a board of 4 founding members; Hugh Carling, Kyle Rollins, Thomas Woodnutt and Patrick Affleck.  It is based in The Muse at 269, an art gallery in the [[Portobello Road]], [[West London]].

The birth and growth of the Web Co-operative movement is documented in detail in an online blog at the Liveline.TV website, hosted on [[Windows Live Spaces]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of theories attempting to address [[technology]], which tend to be associated with the disciplines of [[Science and Technology Studies|science and technology studies]] (STS) and [[communication studies]]. Most generally, the theories attempt to address the relationship between [[technology and society]] and prompt questions about [[Structure and agency|agency]], [[Technological Determinism|determinism/autonomy]], and [[teleonomy]].

{{Essay-like|date=January 2010}}
If forced, one might categorize them into social and group theories. Additionally, one might distinguish between descriptive and critical theories. ''Descriptive'' theories attempt to address the definition and substance of technology, how does it emerge, change, and, of course, what is its relation to the human/social sphere? More substantively, to what extent is technology autonomous and how much force does it have in determining social structure or human practice? ''Critical'' '''theories of technology''' often take a descriptive theory as their basis and articulate concerns and ask in what ways can that relationship be changed? The authors mentioned in this article are those that have some concern with technology or media, though they often borrow from one another and of course build upon seminal theorists that preceded them.

== Social theories ==
=== Descriptive approaches ===

* [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) -  posits a heterogeneous network of humans and non-humans as equal interrelated actors. It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds. For example, Latour (1992) argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology, we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic: technology is made by humans, substitutes for the actions of humans, and shapes human action. What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competences, and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations. Key concepts include the '''inscription''' of beliefs, practices, relations into technology, which is then said to '''embody''' them. Key authors include [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] (1997) and Callon (1999).

* [[Social construction of technology]] (SCOT) - argues that technology does not determine human action, but that human action shapes technology. Key concepts include:
** '''interpretive flexibility''': &quot;Technological artifacts are culturally constructed and interpreted ... By this we mean not only that there is flexibility in how people think of or interpret artifacts but also that there is flexibility in how artifacts are designed.&quot; 
** '''relevant social group''': shares a particular set of meanings about an artifact
** '''closure''' and stabilization: when the relevant social group has reached a consensus 
** wider context: &quot;the sociocultural and political situation of a social group shapes its norms and values, which in turn influence the meaning given to an artifact&quot; 
: Key authors include Pinch and Bijker (1992) and Kline.

*[[Structuration theory]] - defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices, enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Key authors include DeSantis and Poole (1990), and Orlikowski (1992). 

* [[Systems theory]] - considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include '''reverse salients''' when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, operational closure, and autopoietic autonomy. Key authors include [[Thomas P. Hughes]] (1992) and [[Luhmann]] (2000).

==== Critical theories ====

* Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include [[Nissenbaum]] (2001).

==== Other stances ====

Additionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, [[Steve Woolgar]] (1991) considers ''technology as text'' in order to critique the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992) treats ''technology as drama'' to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological &quot;statements&quot; and &quot;counterstatements&quot; within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.

An important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by [[Bernard Stiegler]], whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including [[Gilbert Simondon]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]].

== Group theories ==

There are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).

* [[Social presence theory]] (Short, et al., 1976) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the ''social presence'' it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of &quot;presence&quot;: greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence. 

* [[Media richness theory]] (Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986) shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's ''richness''. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with &quot;rich&quot; media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.

* [[Media naturalness theory]] (Kock, 2001; 2004) builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.

* Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis &amp; Valacich, 1999]) redirects richness theory towards the ''synchronicity'' of the communication. 

* The social identity model of deindividuation effects (or SIDE model, Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995; Spears &amp; Lea, 1994) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or &quot;deindividuated&quot;). It provided an alternative explanation for these &quot;[[deindividuation]] effects&quot; based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make &quot;salient&quot; particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two. 

* Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991) theory describes work groups as time-based, multi-modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles).

== Analytic theories ==

Finally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.

For example, Markus and Robey (1988) propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.

Orlikowski (1992) notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:
# technological imperative: focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency
# strategic choice: focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users
# technology as a trigger of structural change: views technology as a social object

DeSanctis and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: 
# decision-making: the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches
# institutional school: technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power
# an integrated perspective (social technology): soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory

Bimber (1998) addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:
# normative: an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society)
# nomological: a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). 
# [[unintended consequence]]s: a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rapid Serial Visual Presentation''' (RSVP) is a method of displaying information (generally text or images) in which the text is displayed word-by-word in a fixed focal position.  Aside from a basic reading aid, RSVP is being researched as a tool to increase individual reading rates.  RSVP is also being utilized for research in the fields of Visual Impairment, [[Dyslexia]], [[perceptual psychology|perceptual]] and [[cognitive psychology]]. RSVP is available in software on multiple platforms and in many different languages worldwide. 

== Advantages ==
The unique method utilized by RSVP allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon have found that as many as 12 words per second are readable in controlled situations (720wpm) &lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=572014&amp;type=pdf&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=64375389&amp;CFTOKEN=27855784 Carnegie Mellon]&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text, RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/rwlugtlrvjp5yyev Towards an Improved Readability on Mobile Devices: Evaluating Adaptive Rapid Serial Visual Presentation]&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Research done by the [[Wichita State University]] suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader ([[EReader]]).  Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by 20% &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071222063502/http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/rsvp_palm.htm Wichita State]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing. RSVP allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofvision.org/7/2/20/article.aspx Journal of Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices ===

Using RSVP based browsers offers a space-time trade-offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and PDA’s. However to make this solution functional location and context related questions like ‘Where am I’, ‘Where can I usefully go’, ‘Where have I been’ and ‘How do I get back to X’, need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/6eg9wb6x5dgrpla0/ RSVP Browser: Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Uses ==
RSVP can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words.  

=== RSVP and Peripheral Reading ===
Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from [[Central scotoma|central field loss]], which is most commonly seen in the elderly.  Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements.  Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofvision.org/7/2/20/article.aspx Journal of Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Dyslexia ===
For those suffering from [[Dyslexia]], RSVP decreases confusion by helping the reader maintain the correct order of the sentence with its one word at a time format, thus leading to a better understanding of the material.

=== RSVP and Sexual Offenders ===
Research has shown that images presented in RSVP have the potential to elicit a response from sexual offenders by measuring the effects of [[attentional blink]].  A stronger attentional blink is expected among sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images.  This response could potentially help identify sexual offenders and the profile of such criminals&lt;ref&gt;[http://sax.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/21/2/135 Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Drawbacks ==
* [[Repetition Blindness]] - When presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location, readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series, thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text.
* [[Attentional blink]] - The mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord, which can put the reader behind in a sequence.
* [[Temporal masking]] - Certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word.

[[File:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|right|By the mid 20th century, humans had achieved a mastery of technology sufficient to leave the atmosphere of the Earth for the first time and [[space exploration|explore space]].]]
'''Technology''' is the usage and knowledge of [[tool]]s, techniques, and [[craft]]s, or is [[system]]s or methods of organization, or is a material product (such as [[clothing]]) of these things. The word ''[[wikt:technology|technology]]'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''technología'' (''[[wikt:τεχνολογία|τεχνολογία]]'') — ''téchnē'' (''[[wikt:τέχνη|τέχνη]]''), 'craft' and ''[[wikt:logia|-logía]]'' (''[[wikt:λογία|-λογία]]''), the study of something, or the branch of knowledge of a discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology | title=Definition of technology | accessdate=2007-02-16 | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include &quot;construction technology&quot;, &quot;medical technology&quot;, or &quot;[[state-of-the-art]] technology&quot;.

Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The [[prehistory|prehistorical]] discovery of the ability to control [[fire]] increased the available sources of food and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of [[weapon]]s of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from [[club (weapon)|clubs]] to [[nuclear weapon]]s.

Technology has affected [[society]] and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[leisure]] [[Social class|class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as [[pollution]], and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the [[Earth]] and its [[natural environment|environment]]. Various implementations of technology influence the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.

Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other [[primates]] and certain [[dolphin]] communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.
==Definition and usage==
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The invention of the [[printing press]] made it possible for scientists and [[politician]]s to communicate their ideas with ease, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as a cultural force.]]
The use of the the term ''technology'' has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and usually referred to the description or study of the useful arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crabb&quot;&gt;For ex., George Crabb, [http://www.archive.org/stream/universaltechno01crabgoog#page/n525 ''Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences, Containing Definitions Drawn From the Original Writers''], (London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, 1823), s.v. &quot;technology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The term was often connected to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratton&quot;&gt;Julius Adams Stratton and Loretta H. Mannix, Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005), 190-92. ISBN
0262195240.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Technology&quot; rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[second industrial revolution]]. In the process, the concept of technology became associated with the worlds of science, big business, and engineering, implicitly excluding workers, women, and non-Western peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldenziel&quot;&gt;Ruth Oldenziel, ''Making Technology Masculine: Men, Women and Modern Machines in America, 1870-1945'' (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 1999), esp. chap. 1. ISBN 90-5356-381-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marx&quot;&gt;Leo Marx, [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=9710256731 &quot;''Technology'': The Emergence of a Hazardous Concept,&quot;] ''Social Research'' 64 (Fall 1997): 965-88.&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of technology changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of [[:de:Technik|Technik]] into &quot;technology.&quot; In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'' that is absent in English, as both terms are usually translated as &quot;technology.&quot; By the 1930s, &quot;technology&quot; referred not to the study of the industrial arts, but to the industrial arts themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzberg&quot;&gt;Eric Schatzberg, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v047/47.3schatzberg.html &quot;''Technik'' Comes to America: Changing Meanings of ''Technology'' Before 1930,&quot;] ''Technology and Culture'' 47 (July 2006): 486-512.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that &quot;technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bain&quot;&gt;Read Bain, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2084365 &quot;Technology and State Government,&quot;] American Sociological Review 2 (December 1937): 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. But equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science, especially among scientists and engineers, although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKenzie&quot;&gt;Donald A. MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman, &quot;Introductory Essay&quot; in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', 2nd ed. (Buckingham, England : Open University Press, 1999) ISBN 0-335-19913-5.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of &quot;technique&quot; to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on [[technologies of the self]] (&quot;techniques de soi&quot;).

Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary offers a definition of the term: &quot;the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area&quot; and &quot;a capability given by the practical application of knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwdict&quot; /&gt; [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 &quot;Real World of Technology&quot; lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is &quot;practice, the way we do things around here&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anansi.ca/titles.cfm?series_id=4&amp;pub_id=58 | title=Real World of Technology | accessdate=2007-02-13 | author=Franklin, Ursula | publisher=[[House of Anansi Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/default.stm | title=Technology news | accessdate=2006-02-17 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as &quot;the pursuit of life by means other than life&quot;, and as &quot;organized inorganic matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]] | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=0-8047-3041-3 | pages=17, 82}} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as &quot;organized inorganic matter,&quot; given that it is, rather, &quot;the reorganization of the organic.&quot; {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=2-7071-5495-4 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm | work=Science and Engineering Indicators 2002 | title=Industry, Technology and the Global Marketplace: International Patenting Trends in Two New Technology Areas | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;technology&quot; can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as &quot;medical technology&quot; or &quot;space technology&quot;, it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. &quot;[[State-of-the-art]] technology&quot; refers to the [[high technology]] available to humanity in any field.

Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Borgmann | first=Albert | authorlink=Albert Borgmann | year=2006 | title=Technology as a Cultural Force: For Alena and Griffin | journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=351–360 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_journal_of_sociology/v031/31.3borgmann.html | format=fee required | accessdate=2007-02-16 | doi=10.1353/cjs.2006.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of [[communication]] technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and, as a result, has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of [[cyberculture]] has, at its basis, the development of the [[Internet]] and the [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://macek.czechian.net/defining_cyberculture.htm | title=Defining Cyberculture | accessdate=2007-05-25 | author=Macek, Jakub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both [[science]] and [[engineering]], each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.

==Science, engineering and technology==
The distinction between science, engineering and technology is not always clear. [[Science]] is the [[reasoned]] investigation or study of phenomena, aimed at discovering enduring principles among elements of the [[phenomenal]] world by employing [[formal]] techniques such as the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science | title=Science | accessdate=2007-02-17 | publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as [[utility]], [[usability]] and [[safety]].

Engineering is the [[goal-oriented]] process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering — although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s, by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines, such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ | title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology | accessdate=2007-02-17 | publisher=[[Intute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, in the United States it was widely considered that technology was simply &quot;applied science&quot; and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science—The Endless Frontier'': &quot;New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.&quot; In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious—though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=George |last=Wise |title=Science and Technology |journal=Osiris (2nd Series) |volume=1 |year=1985 |pages=229–246 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David H. |last=Guston |title=Between politics and science: Assuring the integrity and productivity of research |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0521653185 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=2007-12-08 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] &quot;industry&quot;, date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=2007-02-18 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=1999-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | month=April | year=1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or &quot;Old stone age&quot;, and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a &quot;[[lithic core|core]]&quot; of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced a sharp edge on the core stone as well as on the flakes, either of which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ea_archaeology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including butchering carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[hides|hide]]; and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were crude, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;ea_archaeology&quot; /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[Lithic reduction#Pressure flaking|pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=0534624871|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire====
The discovery and utilization of fire, a simple [[energy]] source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Crump | first=Thomas | title=A Brief History of Science | year=2001 | publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson]] | isbn=1-84119-235-X | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the [[Cradle of Humankind]] suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=915 | title=Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and Environs | accessdate=2007-03-10 | publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly consensus indicates that [[Homo erectus]] had controlled fire by between 500,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 400,000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab10 | title=History of Stone Age Man | accessdate=2007-02-13 | publisher=History World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hominid Use of Fire in the Lower and Middle Pleistocene | last=James | first=Steven R. | journal=[[Current Anthropology]] | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=1–26 | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204(198902)30%3A1%3C1%3AHUOFIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J | format=fee required | month=February | year=1989 | doi=10.1086/203705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire, fueled with [[wood]] and [[charcoal]], allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stahl | first= Ann B. | year=1984 | title=Hominid dietary selection before fire | journal=[[Current Anthropology]] | volume=25 | pages= 151–168 | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204(198404)25%3A2%3C151%3AHDSBF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E | format=fee required | doi=10.1086/203106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clothing and shelter====
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were [[clothing]] and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380,000&amp;nbsp;BC, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/mod_homo_3.htm | title=Evolution of Modern Humans: Archaic Homo sapiens Culture | accessdate=2007-03-31 | author=O'Neil, Dennis | publisher=[[Palomar College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Villa | first=Paola | year=1983 | title=Terra Amata and the Middle Pleistocene archaeological record of southern France| publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] | isbn= 0-520-09662-2 |page= 303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to [[Historical migration|migrate]]
out of Africa by 200,000&amp;nbsp;BC and into other continents, such as [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cordaux | first=Richard | coauthors=Stoneking, Mark | title=South Asia, the Andamanese and the genetic evidence for an &quot;early&quot; human dispersal out of Africa | journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] | year=2003 | volume=72 | url=http://site.voila.fr/rcordaux/pdfs/04.pdf |format=PDF| pages=1586 | doi=10.1086/375407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans began to work bones, [[antler]], and [[hides]], as evidenced by [[burin]]s and [[racloir]]s produced during this period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Neolithic through Classical Antiquity (10,000BC – 300AD)===
[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]
Man's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the [[Neolithic]] period (&quot;New stone age&quot;). The invention of polished [[stone axe]]s was a major advance because it allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. The discovery of [[agriculture]] allowed for the feeding of larger populations, and the transition to a [[sedentism|sedentist]] lifestyle increased the number of children that could be simultaneously raised, as young children no longer needed to be carried, as was the case with the nomadic lifestyle. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060103114116.htm|title=The First Baby Boom: Skeletal Evidence Shows Abrupt Worldwide Increase In Birth Rate During Neolithic Period|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|date=2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0011-3204(197204)13%3A2%3C258%3AACTFSA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5|title=Child Transport, Family Size, and Increase in Human Population During the Neolithic|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|author=Sussman, Robert W. |coauthors= Hall, Roberta L.|volume=13|issue=2| pages=258–267|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|month=April|year=1972|doi=10.1086/201274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=isGyuX9motEC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=labor+neolithic+population&amp;source=web&amp;ots=SehEQ4H3bw&amp;sig=thq_cZXpdkanmO4rNe7DzcswmR0#PPA163,M1|title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|author=Ferraro, Gary P.|year=2006|isbn=0495030392}}&lt;/ref&gt; What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as [[Uruk]], and the first civilizations, such as [[Sumer]], is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] social structures, the specialization of labor, trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges, such as the building of [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and [[reservoir]]s, are all thought to have played a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8pKKwlEcpwYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=labor+surplus+neolithic+population&amp;source=web&amp;ots=P4xGsewlSs&amp;sig=CB8Kcgsobsfz03KMstsE-DbSyoU#PPA10,M1|accessdate=2008-05-17|title=The ESSENTIALS of Ancient History|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|author=Patterson, Gordon M.|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Metal tools====
Continuing improvements led to the [[furnace]] and [[bellows]] and provided the ability to [[smelting|smelt]] and [[forge]] native metals (naturally occurring in relatively pure form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://neon.mems.cmu.edu/cramb/Processing/history.html | title=A Short History of Metals | accessdate=2007-01-08 | last=Cramb | first=Alan W | publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold]], [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[lead]], were such early metals. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of [[Neolithic]] times (about 8000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VANVAEjBG-QC&amp;pg=PA708&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=fl2NR6ODGYbWiwGW8Zi_BA|accessdate=2008-05-17|author= Chisholm, Hugh|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=1910|page=708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of [[alloys]] such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]] (about 4000 BC). The first uses of iron alloys such as [[steel]] dates to around 1400 BC.

====Energy and Transport====
Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The earliest record of a ship under sail is shown on an Egyptian pot dating back to 3200 BC.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used &quot;the power of the Nile&quot; annual floods to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely-built irrigation channels and 'catch' basins. Similarly, the early peoples of Mesopotamia, the Sumerians, learned to use the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for much the same purposes. But more extensive use of wind and water (and even human) power required another invention.

[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[wheel]] was invented in circa 4000 BC.]]
According to archaeologists, the [[wheel]] was invented around 4000 B.C. The wheel was probably independently invented in Mesopotamia (in present-day [[Iraq]]) as well. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 B.C., with most experts putting it closer to 4000 B.C. The oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3000 B.C.; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. There is also evidence from the same period of time that wheels were used for the production of [[Potter's wheel|pottery]]. (Note that the original potter's wheel was probably not a wheel, but rather an irregularly shaped slab of flat wood with a small hollowed or pierced area near the center and mounted on a peg driven into the earth. It would have been rotated by repeated tugs by the potter or his assistant.) More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/country/veneti/AmerDomoOldestWheel.html | title=Slovenian Marsh Yields World's Oldest Wheel | accessdate=2007-02-13 | publisher=Ameriška Domovina | date=2003-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the wheel revolutionized activities as disparate as transportation, war, and the production of pottery (for which it may have been first used). It didn't take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads and fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery. But it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources.

===Modern history (300 AD —)===
Tools include both [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]), and more complex machines (such as the [[clock]], the [[engine]], the [[electric generator]] and the [[electric motor]], the [[computer]], radio, and the [[Space Station]], among many others). As tools increase in complexity, so does the type of knowledge needed to support them. Complex modern machines require libraries of written technical manuals of collected information that has continually increased and improved — their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require the mastery of decades of sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these tools have become so complex that a comprehensive infrastructure of technical knowledge-based lesser tools, processes and practices (complex tools in themselves) exist to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]]. Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to construct and maintain them. Entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools.
The relationship of technology with society ( culture) is generally characterized as synergistic, symbiotic, co-dependent, co-influential, and co-producing, i.e. technology and society depend heavily one upon the other (technology upon culture, and culture upon technology). It is also generally believed that this synergistic relationship first occurred at the dawn of humankind with the invention of simple tools, and continues with modern technologies today. Today and throughout history, technology influences and is influenced by such societal issues/factors as economics, values, ethics, institutions, groups, the environment, government, among others.
The discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society and vice versa is called Science and technology in society.

==Technology and philosophy==
===Technicism===
Generally, [[technicism]] is an over reliance or overconfidence in technology as a benefactor of society.

Taken to extreme, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology. In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Monsma,&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsma 1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority.

===Optimism===
{{See also|Extropianism}}
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good. Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite paper| author = Hughes, James| title = Democratic Transhumanism 2.0| year= 2002 | url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pessimism===
{{See also|Luddite|Neo-luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}}
On the somewhat pessimistic side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]''. They suggest that the result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.

Many, such as the [[Luddite]]s and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious reservations, although not ''a priori'' flawed reservations, about technology. Heidegger presents such a view in &quot;[[The Question Concerning Technology]]&quot;: &quot;Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the essence of technology so long as we merely conceive and push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade it. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidegger 1977&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=2007-11-21 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics, for example [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] ''[[Brave New World]]'' and other writings, [[Anthony Burgess|Anthony Burgess's]] ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell|George Orwell's]] ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. And, in ''[[Faust]]'' by [[Goethe]], Faust's selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world, is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology.

An overtly anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by [[Theodore Kaczynski]] (aka The [[Unabomber]]) and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure.

===Appropriate technology===
{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}
The notion of [[appropriate technology]], however, was developed in the 20th century (e.g., see the work of [[Jacques Ellul]]) to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[eco-village]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.

==Other animal species==
[[File:Gorilla tool use.png|right|thumbnail|This adult [[gorilla]] uses a branch as a [[walking stick]] to gauge the water's depth; an example of technology usage by primates.&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Credit: [[Public Library of Science]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]&lt;!-- Could do with cropping --&gt;
The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans. These include primates such as [[chimpanzee]]s, some [[dolphin]] communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb//anthro2003/origins/hominid_journey/optional3.html | title=Chimpanzee Tool Use | accessdate=2007-02-13 | author=Sagan, Carl; Druyan, Ann; Leakey, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4613709.stm | title=Sponging dolphins learn from mum. | accessdate=2007-02-13 | author=Rincon, Paul | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2005-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[crow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21135366/|title=Crows use tools to find food|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=2007-10-04|author=Schmid, Randolph E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rutz, C.; Bluff, L.A.; Weir, A.A.S.; Kacelnik, A.|title=Video cameras on wild birds|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control, we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams, or bees and their honeycombs.

The ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus [[Homo (genus)|Homo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Oakley | first=K. P. | title=Man the Tool-Maker | publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1976 | isbn=978-0226612706}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf sponges, termite fishing probes, [[pestle]]s and [[lever]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McGrew | first=W. C | year=1992 | title=Chimpanzee Material Culture | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0521423717 | publisher=Cambridge Univ.

'''Self-powered equipment''' is a term used for [[electrical appliance]]s which can be powered by human muscle power as an alternative to conventional sources of electricity such as [[primary batteries]] and the [[power grid]]

Such devices contain [[electrical generator]]s or an [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] system to recharge their [[rechargeable battery|batteries]].  Separate crank operated [[Electrical generator|generators]] are now available to recharge battery powered portable electronic devices such as [[cell phone]]s.  Others, such as [[mechanically powered flashlight]]s, have the generator integrated within the device itself.  A promising alternative to rechargeable batteries for electricity storage is [[supercapacitor]]s, now being used in some devices such as the mechanically powered flashlight shown here.  

Other devices store the energy mechanically, instead of in batteries.  [[Clockwork radio]]s have a [[mainspring]] which is wound up by a crank, and then turns a generator to power the radio.

==Uses==
Self powered devices are useful as emergency equipment, when [[natural disaster]], [[war]] or [[civil disturbance]] make regular power supplies unavailable.  They have also been seen as economical for use in poor countries, where batteries may be expensive and [[mains power]] unreliable or unavailable.  They are also an environmentally preferable alternative to the use of [[primary battery|disposable batteries]], which are somewhat wasteful source of energy and may introduce [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] into the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

==Examples==
* [[Clockwork radio]]
* [[Mechanically powered flashlight]]
* [[Pedal radio]]
* [[Flashlight#Power_sources|Solar-powered flashlight]]
* [[Batteryless radio]]

'''Music instrument technology''' refers to the construction of instruments and to the way in which they have changed over time. Such change has produced modern instruments that are considerably different from their historical antecedents.

An example is the way in which many instruments commonly associated with a modern symphony orchestra are markedly different from the same instruments for which European composers were composing music centuries ago. Such changes include the addition of piston valves to brass instruments, the design of more complex fingering systems for woodwind instruments such as the flute, and the standardization of the family of orchestral string instruments.

'''Science and technology studies''' ('''STS''') is the study of how social, political, and cultural values affect scientific research and technological innovation, and how these in turn affect society, politics, and culture. STS scholars are interested in a variety of problems including the relationships between scientific and technological innovations and society, and the directions and risks of science and technology. More than two dozen universities worldwide offer baccalaureate degrees in STS; about half of these also offer doctoral or master's  programs.  


==History==
STS is a new and expanding subject; for example, in 2005, four major U.S. universities announced new STS programs.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, it emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest -- typically, during the 1960s or 1970s-- in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.
 
===Early developments===
The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwig Fleck]]'s monograph (1935) ''[[Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact]]''  anticipated many of STS's key themes:

*[[Science studies]], a branch of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] that places scientific controversies in their social context. 
*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific 'natural' development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of  [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the University of California, Berkeley and elsewhere that brought historians of science and philosophers together in unified programs. 
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]  In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[Women's Studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of &quot;science, technology, and society&quot; programs, which are also -- confusingly -- known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history, political science, and sociology, scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by science and technology. Unlike scholars in science studies, history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, &quot;ivory tower&quot; researchers{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of women from science and engineering.
*[[Science, engineering, and public policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public’s best interests. The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow’s science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into systems engineering. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the U.S., UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities.  For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities -- it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students -- means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in engineering ethics.

===The &quot;turn to technology&quot;===
A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science studies programs.  During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the “[[turn to technology]]”:  ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes ''et al.'', 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by collecting a highly readable collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the [[social construction of technology]]. 

The &quot;turn to technology&quot; helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to materiality, whereby the socio-technical and material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations:

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities -- including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings -- that were mainly attended by science studies scholars, but the society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word &quot;technology&quot; to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, but there seems to be widespread sentiment that the name is long enough as it is.

In Europe, the [http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)]  was founded in 1981 to ''stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology''.

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the &quot;turn to technology&quot; in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars in the US, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the [[American Association for the History of Medicine]]. In addition, there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Journals==
Important journals in STS are [http://sss.sagepub.com/ Social Studies of Science], [http://sth.sagepub.com Science, Technology and Human Values], [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/respol Research Policy], [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/CSAC Science as Culture] and [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/beech/spp Science and Public Policy].

==Academic Departments==
In the UK, the [[Department of Science and Technology Studies]] was created at [[University College London]] in 1994, renamed from the Department of History and Philosophy of Science (originated in 1938, renamed from the Department of History and Method of Science, which originated in 1921).&lt;ref&gt;Smeaton, William A. 1997.

'''Packaging''' is the science, art and technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution, storage, sale, and use.  Packaging also refers to the ''process'' of design, evaluation, and production of packages. Packaging can be described as a ''coordinated system'' of preparing goods for transport, warehousing, logistics, sale, and end use.  Packaging contains, protects, preserves, transports, informs, and sells.&lt;ref&gt;Soroka (2002) ''Fundamentals of Packaging Technology'', Institute of Packaging Professionals ISBN 1-930268-25-4&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries it is fully integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and personal use.

'''Package labelling''' (en-GB) or '''labeling''' (en-US) is any written, electronic, or graphic communications on the packaging or on a separate but associated [[label]].

==The purposes of packaging and package labels==
Packaging and package labeling have several objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

:&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Physical protection''' - The objects enclosed in the package may require protection from, among other things, [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]], [[vibration]], compression, [[temperature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Choi |first= Seung-Jin|authorlink= |coauthors=Burgess |year=2007 |month=November |title=Practical mathematical model to predict the performance of insulating packages|journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=369–380 |id=DOI: 10.1002/pts.747 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, etc.
* '''Barrier protection''' - A barrier from [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], dust, etc., is often required. [[Permeation]] is a critical factor in design. Some packages contain [[desiccant]]s or [[Oxygen absorber]]s to help extend shelf life.  [[Modified atmosphere]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun|authorlink= |coauthors= Kim, An, Lyu, Lee|year=1998 |month=November |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |pages= |id=DOI: 10.1002/pts.821|url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages. Keeping the contents clean, fresh, [[Asepsis|sterile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Severin |first=J|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |month=July |title=New Methodology for Whole-Package Microbial Callenge Testing for Medical Device Trays|journal=J. Testing and Evaluation|volume=35 |issue=4 |pages= |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and safe for the intended [[shelf life]] is a primary function.
* '''Containment or agglomeration''' - Small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 pencils requires less physical handling than 1000 single pencils. [[Liquid]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], and [[granular material]]s need containment.
* '''Information transmission''' - Packages and [[label]]s communicate how to use, transport, [[recycling|recycle]], or dispose of the package or product. With [[Medication|pharmaceutical]]s, [[food]], [[medicine|medical]], and [[chemical substance|chemical]] products, some types of information are [[Mandatory labelling|required]] by governments. Some packages and labels also are used for [[track and trace]] purposes. 
* '''Marketing''' - The packaging and [[label]]s can be used by [[marketing|marketers]] to encourage potential buyers to purchase the product. Package [[graphic design]] and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomenon for several decades. [[Marketing communications]] and [[graphic design]] are applied to the surface of the package and (in many cases)  the [[point of sale display]]. 
* '''Security''' - Packaging can play an important role in reducing the [[security]] risks of shipment.  Packages can be made with improved [[tamper resistance]] to deter tampering and also can have [[tamper-evident]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first= R.G.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |month=July |title=Effective Vulnerability Assessment of Tamper-Indicating Seals|journal=J. Testing and Evaluation|volume=25 |issue=4 |pages= |id=|url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; features to help indicate tampering.  Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of [[package pilferage]]:  Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage and some have pilfer indicating seals.  Packages may include [[authentication]] seals and use [[security printing]] to help indicate that the package and contents are not [[counterfeit]]. Packages also can include anti-theft devices, such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]&lt;ref&gt;HowStuffWorks.com, “How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work”, &lt;http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate.  Using packaging in this way is a means of [[Retail loss prevention|loss prevention]].
* '''Convenience''' - Packages can have features that add convenience in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, use, dispensing, and reuse.
* '''Portion control''' - Single serving or single [[drug delivery|dosage]] packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households.  It is also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter-bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.

==Packaging types==
[[Image:Packages.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Various household packaging types for foods]]
Packaging may be looked at as being of several different types.  For example a '''transport package''' or '''distribution package''' can be the [[shipping container]] used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages.  Some identify a '''consumer package''' as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.

Packaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: [[medical device]] packaging, bulk [[chemical substance|chemical]] packaging, [[over-the-counter drug]] packaging, retail [[food]] packaging, military [[materiel]] packaging, [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] packaging, etc.
[[Image:Can(Easy Open Can).JPG|thumb|175px|Aluminium can with a [[Tab (beverage can)|pull tab]]]]

It is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: &quot;primary&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot;, etc.
*Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.
*Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, perhaps used to group primary packages together.
*Tertiary packaging is used for [[logistics|bulk handling]], [[warehouse]] storage and [[transport]] shipping. The most common form is a [[pallet]]ized [[unit load]] that packs tightly into [[containerization|container]]s.

These broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary.  For example, depending on the use, a [[shrink wrap]] can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when combining smaller packages, and tertiary packaging on some distribution packs.

==Symbols used on packages and labels==
Many types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized.  For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications, [[trademark]]s, [[proof of purchase]], etc.  Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer use and safety. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include: [[Recycling symbol]], [[Resin identification code]] (below), and [[Green Dot (symbol)]].[[Image:Resin-identification-code-1-PETE.svg|center|50px|1-PETE]]

[[Barcode|Bar codes]] (below), [[Universal Product Code]]s, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels are common to allow automated information management in [[logistics]] and [[retailing]]. [[Country of Origin Labeling]] is often used.
[[Image:Wikipedia barcode 128.svg|thumb|left|&quot;''Wikipedia''&quot; encoded in [[Code 128]]]]

===Shipping container labeling===
[[Image:Print n apply ucc.jpg|right|thumb|175px||UCC Application|&quot;Print &amp; Apply&quot; corner wrap UCC ([[GS1-128]]) label application to a pallet load]]

Technologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, [[bar codes]], and electronic data interchange ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]).  These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel.  Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.

Elements of these core technologies include [[Universal Product Code|UPC]]  and [[GS1|EAN]] item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated [[GS1-128]]) bar code [[barcode#Symbologies|symbologies]], and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.

Small parcel carriers often have their own formats.  For example, United Parcel Service has a [[MaxiCode]] 2-D code for parcel tracking.

[[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels for shipping containers are also increasing in usage.  A [[Wal-Mart]] division, [[Sam's Club]], has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on on its suppliers for compliance.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |first=Beth |last=Bacheldor |title=Sam's Club Tells Suppliers to Tag or Pay |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3845/1/1/ |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipments of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] or [[dangerous goods]] have special information and symbols (labels, plackards, etc) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. Two examples are below: 

[[Image:Dangclass3.png|150px|Flammable Liquid]]
[[Image:Dangclass1.svg|150px|Explosives]]

With transport packages, standardised symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some common ones are shown below while others are listed in [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D5445 &quot;Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods&quot; and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 780 &quot;Pictorial marking for handling of goods&quot;.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Package development considerations==
Package design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the [[new product development]] process.  Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.
Package design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, [[marketing]], [[shelf life]], [[quality assurance]], [[logistics]], legal, regulatory, [[graphic design]], end-use, environmental, etc.   The design criteria, performance (specified by [[package testing]]),  completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon.

[[Image:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Transport packaging needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]

An example of how package design is affected by other factors is the relationship to [[logistics]].  When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sortation, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized [[unit load]]s, the structural design of the package can be designed to those specific needs:  vertical stacking, perhaps for a longer time frame.  A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited for another.

With some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the package.  For example with packaging [[food]]s, any package components that may contact the food are [[food contact materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Toxicologist]]s and [[food scientist]]s need to [[verify]] that the packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations.  [[Packaging engineer]]s need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended [[shelf life]] with normal usage.  Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be [[validated]] to comply with regulations and have the well being of the consumer in mind.  

Sometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory.  For example, regulations for an [[over-the-counter drug]] might require the package to be [[tamper-evident]] and [[Child-resistant packaging|child resistant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; :These intentionally make the package difficult to open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoxall |first=|authorlink= |coauthors=Jason, Bradbury, Langley, Wearn, Hayes|year=2006 |month=July |title=Openability: producing design limits for consumer packaging|journal=Packaging Technology and Science |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=183–243 |id=DOI: 10.1002/pts.725 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The intended consumer, however, might be handicapped or elderly and be unable to readily open the package. Meeting all goals is a challenge.

Package design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external [[packaging engineering]]: contract engineers, consultants, vendor evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total [[outsourcing]], etc.  Some sort of formal [[Project planning]] and [[Project management]] methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An effective [[quality management]] system and [[Verification and Validation]] protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.

Package development involves considerations for [[sustainability]], environmental responsibility, and applicable [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[recycling]] regulations.   It may involve a [[life cycle assessment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zabaniotou|first=A|authorlink= |coauthors=Kassidi |year=2003 |month=August |title= Life cycle assessment applied to egg packaging made from polystyrene and recycled paper |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=549–559 |id=doi:10.1016/S0959-6526(02)00076-8    |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;
which considers the material and energy inputs and outputs to the package, the packaged product (contents), the packaging process, the [[logistics]] system&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/smartway/transport/documents/faqs/partnership_overview.pdf|format=PDF|title=SmartWay Transport Partnerships|accessdate=2008-12-22|date= |year=|month= |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[waste management]], etc.  It is necessary to know the relevant regulatory requirements for point of manufacture, sale, and use.

The traditional “three R’s” of reduce, reuse, and recycle are part of a [[waste hierarchy]] which may be considered in product and package development.
[[Image:Waste hierarchy.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]
*Prevention –  Waste prevention is a primary goal.  Packaging should be used only where needed.  Proper packaging can also help prevent waste.  Packaging  plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged-product (contents).  Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package.  A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use:  if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;anon: &quot;Packaging Matters&quot;, page 5 - 8. Institute of Packaging Professionals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.incpen.org/pages/data/PackagingFS.pdf|format=PDF|title=&quot;Packaging Factsheet&quot; |accessdate=2009-02-04|publisher=INCPEN }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Minimization – (also &quot;source reduction&quot;)  The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as one of the criteria to minimize during the package design process. Usually “reduced” packaging also helps minimize costs. Packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |title=The Incredible Shrinking Package |accessdate=2007-07-16 |last= DeRusha|first= Jason|date=  July 16, 2007 |publisher=WCCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reuse –   The [[reuse]] of a package or component for other purposes is encouraged.  Returnable packaging has long been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics systems.  Inspection, cleaning, repair and recouperage are often needed. Some manufacturers re-use the packaging of the incoming parts for a product, either as packaging for the outgoing product&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/94feb/feb94a8.pdf &quot;HP DeskJet 1200C Printer Architecture&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt; or as part of the product itself.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://newsroom-magazine.com/2009/critical-thinking/footprints-in-the-sand/ &quot;Footprints In The Sand&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recycling –  [[Recycling]] is the  reprocessing of materials (pre- and post-consumer) into new products.  Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc.  Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations.
*Energy recovery –  [[Waste-to-energy]] and [[Refuse-derived fuel]] in approved facilities are able to make use of the heat available from the packaging components.
*Disposal –  [[Incineration]], and placement in a sanitary [[landfill]] are needed for some materials.  Certain states within the US regulate packages for toxic contents, which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and leachate from landfill.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.toxicsinpackaging.org  |title= Toxics in Packaging|accessdate=2007-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packages should not be [[litter]]ed.

Development of [[sustainable packaging]] is an area of considerable interest by [[standards organization]]s, government, consumers, packagers, and retailers.

==History==
[[Image:Amphorae.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Amphorae]] on display in [[Bodrum Castle]], [[Turkey]]]]
The first packages used the natural materials available at the time:  [[Basket]]s of reeds, wineskins ([[Bota bag]]s), [[wooden box]]es,  pottery [[vase]]s, ceramic [[amphora]]e,  wooden [[barrel]]s, woven bags, etc.  Processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed: for example, early [[glass]] and  [[bronze]] vessels.  The study of old packages is an important aspect of [[archaeology]].

[[Iron]] and tin plated [[steel]] were used to make [[Tin can|can]]s in the early 19th century.  [[Paperboard]] [[carton]]s and [[corrugated fiberboard]] [[box]]es were first introduced in the late 19th century.

Packaging advancements in the early 20th century included [[Bakelite]] closures on [[bottle]]s, transparent [[cellophane]] overwraps and panels on [[carton]]s, increased processing efficiency and improved [[food safety]].  As additional materials such as [[aluminium|aluminum]] and several types of  [[plastic]] were developed, they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''[[Technology]]''' refers to all [[tool]]s and [[procedure]]s. It is the state of knowledge and development at any given time on controlling our surroundings, and includes all tools (utensils, devices, machinery, inventions, and structures), all methods (skills, processes, and techniques), and all applied materials (both raw and manufactured). In the most general sense, technology is Man's ability to control [[Nature]].

The '''cost-performance''' ratio is the scale of what the product costs as opposed to its effectiveness. According to futurist [[Raymond Kurzweil]], products start out as highly ineffective and highly expensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;raykurzweil&quot;/&gt; Gradually, products become more effective and cheaper until they are highly effective and almost free to purchase.&lt;ref name=&quot;raykurzweil&quot;/&gt; Some of the products that have followed this example include [[AIDS]] medications (which are currently unaffordable to the majority of AIDS sufferers), [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] programs, and digital cameras.&lt;ref name=&quot;raykurzweil&quot;&gt;{{cite book

      <comment>Disambiguate [[spring]] to [[spring (device)]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}
{{norefs|date=March 2010}}

A '''pullstring''' is a [[string]] or cord wound on a [[Spring (device)|spring]]-loaded [[spindle]] that engages a mechanism when it is pulled. It is most commonly used in [[toy]]s and motorized equipment.

For example, some [[doll]]s have a pullstring built into them that activates a [[speaker]] when it is pulled, causing the doll to say a built-in phrase. Also, many motorized [[lawn mower]]s use a pullstring as an [[ignition]] device. [[Attic ladder]]s usually have a pullstring to allow the ladder to be pulled down from the ceiling.

Another type of pullstring (reffered to as a [[drawstring]]) can be used in fashion, mainly used in bags they are used as a closing device and contribute to many aspects of the fashion industry.

    <title>Electrostatic suspension</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Electrostatics|Electrostatic]] suspension can occur whenever a voltage exists between two locations and a charged mass is within the space separating the two locations, where the amount of charge is sufficient to allow suspension or prevent contact with either location. The [[potential gradient]] is the local space rate of change of the [[electric potential]], usually in units of [[volt]]s per [[meter]] (V/m). An electric field is an electric potential of opposite sign. The [[Earth]], for example, has a natural electric field.

Electrostatic suspension is used in several apparati, like the gyroscopes of the space mission [[Gravity Probe B]], commercial gyroscopes, or space accelerometers. Parasitic forces are associated with such a suspension.&lt;ref name=Willemenot&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Willemenot E, Touboul P |title=Electrostatically suspended torsion pendulum |journal=Rev Sci Instr. |month=Jan |year=2000 |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=310-4 |url=http://www.mtl.mit.edu/researchgroups/mems-salon/sriram_torsion-pendulum.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical suspension==

Upper electrodes are used to apply control voltages, e.g., 228 V.&lt;ref name=Willemenot/&gt; The lower electrodes have their voltage controlled to V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, a dc voltage of about 10 V so that no force attracts the mass between the electrodes toward the bottom.&lt;ref name=Willemenot/&gt;

==Horizontal suspension==

Three horizontal axes can be used (two for translation x and y, and rotation φ).&lt;ref name=Willemenot/&gt; The forces between the plates is proportional to the polarization voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) of the mass within the plate grid and the vertical suspension voltage V.&lt;ref name=Willemenot/&gt;

==Electrostatic stiffness==

To keep negative stiffness as low as possible on the horizontal degrees of freedom (x, y, φ), choose the electrode arrangement and shapes so that electrostatic forces depend only on control voltages rather than internal mass position.&lt;ref name=Willemenot/&gt;

==Parasitic force==

Some edge effects can produce small stiffnesses.&lt;ref name=Willemenot/&gt;

==Dusty plasma==
{{main|Dusty plasma}}

The '''Global Energy International Prize''' is one of the world’s largest prizes and is awarded to leading scientists regardless of their nationality, citizenship, religious beliefs, race, sex, or financial status. The main goal of the Prize is to provide stimulus for resolving global energy and ecological problems which are important to all humanity. The Prize is awarded for breakthroughs, discoveries and the large-scale achievements in the field of energy. The Prize is worth US$1 million, and has been called the &quot;[[Nobel Prize]] for power technology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Innovative Minds: A Look Inside Siemens' Idea Machine |last=Eberl |first=Ulrich |coauthors=Jöerg Puma |page=110 |year=2007 |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |isbn=9783895782992
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Global Energy International Prize was founded in 2002 in Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two Russians and American Win Prize |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=817 |work=[[The St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2 June 2004 |accessdate=25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the support of Gazprom, Surgutneftegaz, and FGC UES – the largest oil companies in Russia. Since the inception of the Prize, 20 of the most important scientists from eight countries – UK, Germany, Iceland, Canada, Russia, the USA, France, and Japan – have been awarded the prize. More than 1,700 recognised scientists from 45 countries participate in the nomination process.

The members of the entire management (the Executive Directorate, the Expert Commission, the International Award Committee, and the Board of Trustees) participate directly in the Award Process. 

Stage I is the nomination process. Beginning 1 September, numbered forms are sent out to a base of nominating scientists whose right to nominate has been confirmed by the International Award Committee. From 1 October to 1 March, nominations are accepted for the Prize. These nominations consist of descriptions of projects which have achieved significant results. Only the highest-rated scientists may nominate candidates: Nobel Prize Laureates for physics or chemistry, past Laureates of the Global Energy Prize, and Laureates of the Kyoto, Max Planck, and Wolf prizes have the right to make nominations. Scientists who are involved in the Global Energy Foundation forfeit the right to make nominations. In this way, the Expert Commission and the International Award Committee can remain unbiased and effective in choosing the most worthy Laureates.

Stage II. In the period from 1 March to 1 April, the Expert Commission of the Global Energy International Prize, which includes leading scientists, conducts a preliminary selection of works. The makeup of the Expert Commission is not announced in order to eliminate the risk of influence being exercised on the choice of works provided to the International Committee for the final decision. The members of the Expert Commission choose the top five works, from which the International Committee chooses three Laureates.

Stage III. Out of the five works, the members of the International Award Committee choose three Laureates to be awarded the Global Energy International Prize. The meeting of the International Award Committee and choice of Laureates takes place in April. The 2010 International Committee comprised 35 of the most important scientists and public figures from 13 countries: UK, Hungary, Germany, India, Iceland, Spain, Kazakhstan, Canada, Russia, the USA, Tanzania, France, and Japan. On 15 April 2010, a meeting of the full quorum of the International Award Committee will be held in Moscow, the capital of Russia, for the purpose of determining the Prize Laureates. On 16 April 2010, the names of the 2010 Laureates will be announced at a press conference.

The Award Ceremony will be held in June in St. Petersburg (Russia). According to tradition, the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian president awards Global Energy prizes |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090605/155179538.html |work=[[Ria Novosti]] |date=5 June 2009 |accessdate=25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; will present the Prize to the Laureates.

In this article we cover some of the principal issues concerning the Translation Management Systems. We make a quick overview of the translation management systems. We present and analyze the ontram translation management system with its functionalities, versions and advantages.

== Introduction to the Translation Management Systems ==

The Translation Management Systems are software solutions build to integrate all the different aspects of a translation process. The user defines a number of workflow rules and the software will automatically manage the interaction between all the different stakeholders and tasks of the project. The objective of these systems is to automate as much as possible all the activities involved in the creation and management of the multilingual content. This automation will finish with many of the most current problems that arise during a translation project such as delays or files losses.

The Translation Management Systems can be client-based or web-based. The most modern ones are web-based because in that way the interface is accessible from every computer connected to the internet making it much more flexible. The most common activities included in these systems are change detection, content extraction and packaging, file preparation, customizable workflows, online and offline translation tools, facilitated translation review, TM management, content delivery and reintegration, metrics and reporting, etc. The main objective of a translation management system is to reduce the localisation costs, reduce the time to market and improve the translation quality.

== Ontram Translation Management System ==

Ontram is a web-based Translation Management System whose principal modules are:
* Data filters
* Translation Memory
* Preview Function
* Workflow engine
* Deadline control and monitoring
* Change Management

They are media-neutral and available to any persons involved in the translation and review processes via a very simply operated web interface.
Ontram is specifically designed for use by multilingual operating companies - and covering both product as well as technical communication.

Ontram enables browser-based translation and editing of texts independent of the data format of the source documents. The translation memory, preview function, integrated change management and other productivity functions support the user, document the editing status and ensure a seamless co-operation of the project participants.

Core application and user interface are standardised for all data formats. The document that has to be translated is analysed by a specific data format import filter and the content is separated from the layout. Subsequently, media-neutral content processing is carried out according to the processing steps defined by the workflow. After the translation of the document, the export filter ensures that the generated language versions are converted to the original format. In the translation mode the users can see the source and target language in one window and the [[Translation memory]] provides translation suggestions. The data handling by ontram follows an easy and proven workflow. This ensures that users only process the relevant or required contents.

The advantages of the ontram Translation Management System compared with a conventional TMS are:
* Project management, localization and translation in one system
* Easy-to-use interface for all formats
* Central status monitoring, billing and process management
* Fully integrated Workflow System
* Integration in existing system environments and processes (e.g. Content Management Systems (CMS), e-Learning systems, Editing Systems, Databases, PIM's and ERP's)

== Fields of Application ==

Ontram can be used everywhere where contents have to be localized regularly. Also when existing processes and systems already support multilingualism, it is often useful to store the translation and review processes in a professional translation system. The interfaces support the exchange of content data and workflow information. The savings potential compared to traditional translation processes is enormous.

The start and end of the ontram workflow in the process chain, the project-specific workflow steps and the associated responsibilities and roles can be defined individually. Translation tasks are unequivocally assigned to the processors, which avoids any unclear status information. The system automatically compares the actual and target situation. In the event of deviations, ontram initiates previously defined escalation steps.

Ontram can be integrated in the operations as an intelligent web service, for instance based on [[SOAP]] or [[CORBA]] if allowed by existing system structures. As soon as it is established that the contents have to be processed, they are automatically transferred to ontram and translated and reviewed with the aid of ontram and then transferred back automatically.

If the same or a similar text has already been translated, ontram recognises this automatically and provides the translator with the available translations. If the translation is a 100% match of the text, the text can be copied after a short verification. Any deviations are shown so that the necessary changes can be made. In addition to a reduction of the project costs, it also leads to a standardisation of the translation style and considerably reduces subsequent review costs. Ontram also provides high quality assurance, spell checking, projects deadline management and changes management.

The supported data formats compatibility of ontram currently includes:
* Adobe FrameMaker
* Adobe InDesign
* CMS-XML formats
* CSV
* Flash
* HTML
* Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word
* Office Open XML
* OpenDocument
* QuarkXPress
* SCORM (WBT)
* TYPO3
* XLIFF
* XML

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{About|devices that perform tasks|other uses|Machine (disambiguation)}}
[[file:Bonsack machine.png|right|320px]]
A '''machine''' is any [[Wiktionary:device|device]] that uses [[energy]] to perform some activity. In common usage, the meaning is that of a device having parts that perform or assist in performing any type of [[Manual labour|work]]. A [[simple machine]] is a device that transforms the direction or magnitude of a [[force]] without consuming any energy. The word &quot;machine&quot; is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''machina'',&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary'', Second College Edition. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn derives from the [[Doric Greek]] ''μαχανά'' (machana), [[Ionic Greek]] ''μηχανή'' (mechane) &quot;contrivance, machine, engine&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmhxanh%2F &quot;μηχανή&quot;], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; and that from ''μῆχος'' (mechos), &quot;means, expedient, remedy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dxos &quot;μῆχος&quot;], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Historically, a device required moving parts to be classified as a machine; however, the advent of [[electronics|electronics technology]] has led to the development of devices without moving parts that many refer to as machines—the [[computer]] being the most obvious example.&lt;ref name=AHD/&gt;

&quot;[[Engine]]s&quot; are machines that convert [[heat]] or other forms of energy into [[mechanical energy]]. For example, in an [[internal combustion engine]] the expansion of gases caused by the heat from an [[exothermic]] chemical reaction results in a force being applied to a movable component, such as a [[piston]] or [[Gas turbine|turbine blade]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Internal combustion engine&quot;, ''Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology'', Third Edition, Sybil P. Parker, ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1994, p. 998 .&lt;/ref&gt; An engine is often considered part of a larger machine, such as an [[automobile]] or an [[aircraft]].

Machines are [[Wiktionary:ubiquity|ubiquitous]] in a wide variety of [[Industry|industrial]], commercial, residential and [[transportation]] applications. Those employing [[hydraulics]] are especially useful in [[manufacturing]] and [[construction equipment|construction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Being digital negroponte.gif|thumb|right|''Being Digital'''s front cover]]

'''''Being Digital''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book about digital technologies and their possible future by  technology author [[Nicholas Negroponte]]. It was originally published in [[January 1995]] by [[Random House|Vintage Publishing]]. 

''Being Digital'' provides a general history of several [[digital media]] technologies, many that Negroponte himself was directly involved in developing. Negroponte analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the technologies (such as his belief that [[High-definition television]] wastes broadcasting power), and tries to predict how the technologies will evolve. Negroponte presents a strong belief that humanity is inevitably headed towards a future where everything that can will be digitalized (be it newspapers, entertainment, or sex). This leads Negroponte to a quote repeated often in promoting and explaining the book's material, that the book is made of &quot;unwieldy atoms&quot; that will probably be replaced by a digital copy by the time anyone reads the book. Several [[e-book]]s exist of ''Being Digital'', making the quote rather prophetic.

Being Digital also introduced the &quot;[[Daily Me]]&quot; concept of a virtual daily newspaper customized for an individual's tastes. This prediction has also come to pass with the advent of [[web feed]]s and [[Web portal#Personal portals|personal web portals]].

==Bits and Atoms==
Negroponte writes a lot about the idea of bits and atoms.  He says that bits are the smallest form of information on a computer. He believes that many bits combined make up information on a computer.  Digital music, ebooks, emails and many other types of information on the computer are made of bits.  He also writes about atoms.  Atoms make up physical, tangible objects such as CDs, books and letters.  He believes that in the future all forms of information that are now made of Atoms (books, CDs, etc.) will eventually be turned into bits.
==Negroponte Switch==
It is his idea that digital information that is going through the ground (wires, cables) will eventually be through the air.  Also, the digital information that is going through the air (ethere) will later be going through the ground.  Negroponte called this &quot;trading places,&quot; but it gained the name the &quot;Negroponte Switch.&quot;
==Technological Interface==
Negroponte believes in different forms of interface than we currently have.  He believes that the mouse was an mediocre interface for point and click, and horrible for drawing.  The interfaces were touch-screen technology and voice recognition software.  The IPhone and other touch-screen software proved him correct that touch-screen technology would be a future form of interface.

'''Business Augmentation Services''' is a specialized set of services for managing and nurturing a company in the business of technology and assuring steep growth with clients and sales prospects. It involves using business concepts like branding and strategic planning as well as [[Disruptive Technology]] to organize, automate, and generate business processes—principally [[product design]] and [[sales]] activities, but also those for [[marketing]],[[patents]] ( [[Intellectual Asset Management|IAM]] ), [[customer service]], and [[technical support]]. The overall goals are to innovate in &quot;360 degrees&quot;, in other words, to utilize technology and business ideas in unison and simultaneously to find, attract, and win new clients, nurture and retain those the company already has, entice former clients back into the fold, and reduce the costs of marketing, client service, production, and design all while exponentially increasingly the value of the company and it's products in the customer's eyes. The service set was created based on the belief the business is driven by technology&lt;ref name=key&gt;Keystone Strategy, Inc. (6 June 2009) [http://www.microsoft.com/business/enterprise/itdrivesgrowth.mspx Keystone Strategy, Inc., research study: Information technology drives growth Published in March 13, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Once a company embraces this service set, specialized individuals well-versed in these concepts become necessary to execute them. Once simply a label for a category of software tools, today, it generally denotes a company-wide business strategy embracing all technology as well as client-facing departments and even beyond. When an implementation is effective, people, processes, and technology work in synergy to increase profitability, and reduce operational costs.&lt;ref name=roleit&gt;&quot;The role of information technology in the profit and cost efficiency improvements...&quot; (2005) [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-149213894/role-information-technology-profit.html The role of information technology in the profit and cost efficiency improvements of the banking sector.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
These tools have been shown to help companies attain these objectives:
*Streamlined sales and marketing processes
*New markets and instant, assured leadership in these markets through Patents
*Higher sales productivity
*Added [[cross-selling]] and [[up-selling]] opportunities
*Improved service, loyalty, and retention
*Increased [[Product (business)|Product]][[Research and development|Development]] efficiency (the objective is always a 10x increase)
*Better profiling and targeting as well as new customer profiling and targeting
*Reduced expenses (the objective is a 10x decrease as shown in [[Disruptive Technology]])
*Increased current [[market share]]
*Higher overall profitability

===Related Trends===
New trends are beginning to take hold in this field. Due to the abundance of technical knowledge, the reduction in cost for said knowledge as well as the growing need for velocity when approaching a new market, companies are beginning to turn into &quot;one-stop-shops&quot; for business and technological services, requiring professionals skilled in both fields.  Perhaps the most notable trend has been the growth of tools delivered via the Web, also known as [[cloud computing]] and [[software as a service]] (SaaS). In contrast with traditional on-premises software, cloud-computing applications are sold by subscription, accessed via a secure Internet connection, and displayed on a Web browser. Companies don’t incur the initial capital expense of purchasing software; nor must they buy and maintain IT hardware to run it on. As with all business fields affected by globalization, many companies around the world have created a niche as BAS groups and currently the new companies are creating value in the stagnated field of outsourced business and IT services.

===Challenges===
Despite the benefits, many companies are still not fully leveraging these tools and services, mostly because the areas that deal with business and technology very often are separate entities, and as such may not fully understand each other. BAS is a set of defined services that fuse these previously incongruous areas into processes that have an impact that has yet to be fully understood. To align marketing,engineering, design, sales, and service to best serve the customer while reducing costs, the company needs to reconcile these areas through BAS, which requires juxtaposing previously irreconcilable objectives effectively .&lt;ref name=habib&gt;USING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE COST [http://www.habibbank.com/common/articles/article63.html using technology to reduce costs]&lt;/ref&gt; 

BAS Tools, services and work-flows can be complex to implement, especially for large enterprises. Previously these tools were generally limited.  Software solutions then expanded to embrace things such as design needs, engineering, deal tracking, territories, opportunities, and at the sales pipeline itself. Next came the advent of tools for other client-facing business functions, as described below.  These technologies have been, and still are, offered as on-premises software that companies purchase and run on their own IT infrastructure. Now, companies are emerging to provide these solutions exclusively. In effect, these BAS houses are experts in a relatively new field and as such are not yet widely used by more traditional corporations. 

Often, implementations are fragmented; isolated initiatives by individual departments to address their own needs. Systems that start disunited usually stay that way: siloed thinking and decision processes frequently lead to separate and incompatible systems, and dysfunctional processes, not to mention weak product lines and low market awareness.

==Previous Types/variations==
===Sales Force Automation===
A [[sales force automation]] (SFA) system provides an array of capabilities to streamline all phases of the sales process, minimizing the time that sales representatives need to spend on manual data entry and administration. This allows them to successfully pursue more clients in a shorter amount of time than would otherwise be possible. At the heart of SFA is a [[contact management system]] for tracking and recording every stage in the sales process for each prospective client, from initial contact to final disposition. Many SFA applications also include insights into opportunities, territories, sales forecasts and work-flow automation, quote generation, and product knowledge. Newly-emerged priorities are modules for Web 2.0 e-commerce and pricing.

===Marketing===
Systems for marketing (also known as [[marketing automation]]) help the enterprise identify and target its best clients and generate qualified leads for the sales team. A key marketing capability is tracking and measuring multichannel campaigns, including email, search, social media, and direct mail. Metrics monitored include clicks, responses, leads, deals, and revenue. As marketing departments are increasingly obliged to demonstrate revenue impact, today’s systems typically include features for measuring the [[Overall Rate of Return|ROI]] of campaigns.

===Disruptive IT Service and Support===
Recognizing that disruptive technology is an important differentiation, organizations are increasingly turning to technology platforms to help them improve their clients’ experience while aiming to increase efficiency and minimize costs.&lt;ref name=disruptive&gt;PC world magazine (18 March 2008) [http://www.pcworld.com/article/143474/the_10_most_disruptive_technology_combinations.html The 10 Most Disruptive Technology Combinations]&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, a 2009 study revealed that only 39% of corporate executives believe their employees have the right tools and authority to solve client problems.“.&lt;ref&gt;Strativity Group, Inc. (2009) [http://www.strativity.com/products/2009-05-26.aspx Global Customer Experience Management Benchmark Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytics===
Relevant analytics capabilities are often interwoven into applications in sales, marketing, and service. These features can be complemented and augmented with links to separate, purpose-built applications for analytics and business intelligence. Sales analytics let companies monitor and understand client actions and preferences, through sales forecasting, data quality, and dashboards that graphically display [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs).  

Marketing applications generally come with [[predictive analytics]] to improve segmentation and targeting, and features for measuring the effectiveness of online, offline, and search marketing campaign Web analytics have evolved significantly from their starting point of merely tracking mouse clicks on Web sites. By evaluating “buy signals,” marketers can see which prospects are most likely to transact and also identify those who are bogged down in a sales process and need assistance. Marketing and finance personnel also use analytics to assess the value of multi-faceted programs as a whole. 

These types of analytics are increasing in popularity as companies demand greater visibility into the performance of call centers and other support channels, in order to correct problems before they affect satisfaction levels. Support-focused applications typically include dashboards similar to those for sales, plus capabilities to measure and analyze response times, service quality, agent performance, and the frequency of various issues.

===Integrated/Collaborative===
Departments within enterprises—especially large enterprises—tend to function in their own little worlds.&lt;ref name=mckinseycolab&gt;Using technology to improve workforce collaboration (27 october 2009) [http://whatmatters.mckinseydigital.com/internet/using-technology-to-improve-workforce-collaboration Using technology to improve workforce collaboration]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, inter-departmental interaction and collaboration have been infrequent and rivalries not uncommon.  More recently, the development and adoption of the tools and services has fostered greater fluidity and cooperation among sales,  service, and marketing. This finds expression in the concept of collaborative systems which uses technology to build bridges between departments. 

For example, feedback from a [[technical support]] center can enlighten marketers about specific services and product features clients are asking for. Reps, in their turn, want to be able to pursue these opportunities without the time-wasting burden of re-entering records and contact data into a separate SFA system. Conversely, lack of integration can have negative consequences: if a system isn’t adopted and integrated among all departments, several sources might contact the same clients for an identical purpose.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Owing to these factors, many of the top-rated and most popular products come as integrated suites. 

===Small Business===
Basic client service can be accomplished by a contact manager system, an integrated solution that lets organizations and individuals efficiently track and record interactions, including emails, documents, jobs, faxes, scheduling, and more. This kind of solution is gaining traction with even very small businesses, thanks to the ease and time savings of handling client contact through a centralized application rather than several different pieces of software, each with its own data collection system. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In contrast these tools usually focus on accounts rather than individual contacts. They also generally include opportunity insight for tracking sales pipelines plus added functionality for marketing and service.  As with larger enterprises, small businesses are finding value in online solutions, especially for mobile and [[telecommuting]] workers.

===Social Media===
[[Social media]] sites like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] are greatly amplifying the voice of people in the marketplace and are predicted to have profound and far-reaching effects on the ways companies manage their clients, even to the family level.&lt;ref name=svcp&gt;sjsu.edu(1998) [http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/anthropology/svcp/SVCPcosa.html  Technology and Social Change: The Effects on Family and Community]&lt;/ref&gt; This is because people are using these social media sites to share opinions and experiences on companies, products, and services. As social media isn’t moderated or censored, individuals can say anything they want about a company or brand, whether pro or con. 

Increasingly, companies are looking to gain access to these conversations and take part in the dialogue. More than a few systems are now integrating to social networking sites. Social media promoters cite a number of business advantages, such as using online communities as a source of high-quality leads and a vehicle for [[crowd sourcing]] solutions to client-support problems. Companies can also leverage client stated habits and preferences to personalize and even “hyper-target” their sales and marketing communications.

Some analysts take the view that business-to-business marketers should proceed cautiously when weaving social media into their business processes. These observers recommend careful market research to determine if and where the phenomenon can provide measurable benefits for client interactions, sales, and support.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard business review (2010) [http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2009/11/six_social_media_trends.html Six Social Media Trends for 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-profit and Membership-based===
Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents and their involvement in the organization. Capabilities typically include tracking the following: fund-raising, demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communications with individuals. 

Many include tools for identifying potential donors based on previous donations and participation.  In light of the growth of social networking tools, there may be some overlap between social/community driven tools and non-profit/membership tools.

==Strategy==
Choosing and implementing a system is a major undertaking. For enterprises of any appreciable size, a complete and detailed plan is required to obtain the funding, resources, and company-wide support that can make the initiative successful. Benefits must be defined, risks assessed, and cost quantified in three general areas: 

*Processes: Though these systems have many technological components, business processes lie at its core. It can be seen as a more client-centric way of doing business, enabled by technology that consolidates and intelligently distributes pertinent information about clients, sales, marketing effectiveness, responsiveness, and market trends. Therefore, before choosing a technology platform, a company needs to analyze its business workflows and processes; some will likely need re-engineering to better serve the overall goal of winning and satisfying clients. Moreover, planners need to determine the types of client information that are most relevant, and how best to employ them.
*People: For an initiative to be effective, an organization must convince its staff that change is good and that the new technology and workflows will benefit employees as well as clients. Senior executives need to be strong and visible advocates who can clearly state and support the case for change. Collaboration, teamwork, and two-way communication should be encouraged across hierarchical boundaries, especially with respect to process improvement.&lt;ref&gt;TechTarget (2009) [http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/feature/CRM-strategy-checklist-Planning-for-CRM-and-customer-service-success?offer=briefcaseCRM Strategy Checklist: Planning for CRM and Customer Service Success]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Technology: In evaluating technology, key factors include alignment with the company’s business process strategy and goals; the ability to deliver the right data to the right employees; and sufficient ease of use that users won’t balk. Platform selection is best undertaken by a carefully chosen group of executives who understand the business processes to be automated as well as the various software issues. Depending upon the size of the company and the breadth of data, choosing an application can take anywhere from a few weeks to a year or more.

==Implementation==
===Implementation Issues===
Dramatic increases in revenue, higher rates of client satisfaction, and significant savings in operating costs are some of the benefits to an enterprise.  Proponents emphasize that technology should be implemented only in the context of careful strategic and operational planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='''Passionate and Profitable'''|author= Lior Arussy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2005|chapter=Understanding the Fatal Mistakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementations almost invariably fall short when one or more facets of this prescription are ignored:

*Poor planning: Initiatives can easily fail when efforts are limited to choosing and deploying software, without an accompanying rationale, context, and support for the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='''Avoid the Four Perils of CRM'''|coauthors=, Darrell K.Rigby; Frederick F. Reichheld, Phil Schefter,|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, enterprises simply automate flawed client-facing processes rather than redesign them according to best practices.
*Poor integration: For many companies, integrations are piecemeal initiatives that address a glaring need: improving a particular client-facing process or two or automating a favored sales or client support channel. Such “point solutions” offer little or no integration or alignment with a company’s overall strategy. They offer a less than complete client view and often lead to unsatisfactory user experiences.
*Towards a solution: overcoming siloed thinking. Experts advise organizations to recognize the immense value of integrating their client-facing operations. In this view, internally-focused, department-centric views should be discarded in favor of reorienting processes toward information-sharing across marketing, design, engineering, sales, and service. For example, sales representatives need to know about current issues and relevant marketing promotions before attempting to cross-sell to a specific client. Marketing staff should be able to leverage client information from sales and service to better target campaigns and offers. And support agents require quick and complete access to a client’s sales and service history.

===Adoption Issues===
Enterprises need to address and overcome persistent adoption challenges. Specialists offer these recommendations for boosting adoptions rates and coaxing users to blend these tools into their daily work-flow:

*Choose a system that’s easy to use: All solutions are not created equal. Some vendors offer more user-friendly applications than others, and simplicity should be as important a decision factor as functionality. 
*Focusing on the client's client: it is sometimes difficult to define the &quot;client's client&quot;, and as the central goal of BAS houses is to please exactly this group, this presents an issue with uninitiated users of BAS.
*Choose the right capabilities: Employees need to know that time invested in learning and usage will yield personal advantages. If not, they will work around or ignore the system.
*Provide training: Changing the way people work is no small task, and help is usually a requirement. Even with today’s more usable systems, many staffers still need assistance with learning and adoption.

[[File:Wifire.PNG|thumb|alt=Alt text|The Wi-Fire]]

'''The Wi-Fire'''

The [http://www.hfield.com/ Wi-Fire by hField] is a compact, range-extending [[Wireless USB specification|USB]] device that allows users to access [[Wi-Fi|wireless Internet]] connections.  The company claims that a connection can be reached and maintained from up to 1,000 feet away.  This capability is more than three times the range of a standard internal wireless adapter.&lt;sup&gt;[http://inventorspot.com/articles/review_new_wifire_extends_wifi_r_8559/ 1 ]&lt;/sup&gt;

The Wi-Fire uses a powerful [[directional antenna]], a highly sensitive [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] and proprietary software to find and enhance normal WiFi signals. A computer's internal wireless card is not as sensitive and cannot detect as many networks or maintain as strong of a connection.  Even at low signal strengths the Wi-Fire is faster, more reliable and more consistently strong, than an internal wireless card.

&quot;The palm-size antenna provides faster and more solid connections by combining a sensitive decoding [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] with a directional antenna that [[Amplifier|amplifies]] the signal. Pointing the antenna toward the base station or [[router]] can produce a signal that may be two or three times greater than one from a traditional antenna buried in a laptop. That difference [in signal strength] can turn a back room or the most remote corner of the pool deck into a fully functional Web-browsing location.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/technology/personaltech/06antenna.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=wi-fire&amp;st=cse/ ''The New York Times'']&lt;/sup&gt;

*USB 2.0
*5V DC (from USB Port)
*The Wi-Fire draws very little power from a [[laptop]] battery.

==Operating the Wi-Fire==
#To set up the Wi-Fire you must simply install the Connection Manager [[CD-ROM|(CD-Rom)]] and then plug the Wi-Fire into an available [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port.
#To maximize the [[signal strength]] for a desired network, just rotate the directional antenna (the large flat component of the product) until the signal reaches its maximum strength.
##To simply select the strongest available network – public access or private and encrypted – after plugging in the Wi-Fire, rotate the antenna until you detect a strong signal from a network you are able to connect to, and then click connect in the connection manager.
#Once a desired network is connected to, the most effective way to maximize [[throughput]] is to make sure that the antenna is pointed in the direction of the strongest signal (which may not necessarily be in the exact direction of the wireless signal source).

==What the Wi-Fire does==
===See More Wireless Connections===
The Wi-Fire Connection Manager reveals all available [[Wireless network|networks]] in the area &lt;sup&gt;[http://realgadgetreviews.blogspot.com/2009/09/hfield-technologies-wi-fire-review-long.html]&lt;/sup&gt;.  It allows the user to see more connections than would otherwise be visible without the Wi-Fire.
# You are able to receive Wi-Fi almost anywhere you travel. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2254449,00.asp]&lt;/sup&gt;
# You will never have to move closer to a [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|wifi hotspot]]. &lt;sup&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/02/wi-fire-long-range-wifi-adapter-hands-on-and-impressions/]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Faster Speeds for Internet Browsing===
The Wi-Fire provides higher speeds at lower signal strengths than your typical internal adapter. Independent reviewers have agreed that the Wi-Fire beats [[IEEE 802.11n-2009|802.11n]] products in range and in speed at [http://www.maximumpc.com/article/hfield_technologies_wifire_wifi_adapter/ long distances.]

The Wi-Fire itself is compatible with all [[IEEE 802.11b-1999|802.11b]][[IEEE 802.11g-2003|/g]] protocols.

===Surfing the Web===
The product allows the user to surf the web, tap remote applications, download large files, stream audio and video, exactly the same as how one would normally browse the internet.

Since the adapter attaches to your computers USB port, there is no need to have a [[3G]]/[[4G]] connection, you can simply use the wireless you already receive on your home or laptop computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''GestureTek''' is an American-based interactive technology company headquartered in [[Silicon Valley]], [[California]], with offices in [[Toronto]] and [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gesturetek.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1986 by Canadians Vincent John Vincent&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vjvincent.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and Francis MacDougall&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techthink.org/speaker08_MacDougall.asp&lt;/ref&gt;, this privately-held company develops and licenses [[gesture recognition]] software based on [[computer vision]] techniques.  The partners invented video gesture control in 1986 and received their base [[patent]] in 1996 for the GestPoint video gesture control system. GestPoint technology is a camera-enabled [[video tracking]] software system that translates hand and body movement into computer control.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/ptech/04/23/cnet.touch.screens/&lt;/ref&gt;  The system enables users to navigate and control interactive multi-media and menu-based content, engage in virtual reality game play, experience [[immersion]] in an [[augmented reality]] environment or interact with a consumer device (such a television, mobile phone or set top box) without using touch-based peripherals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/05/gesturetek-brings-3d-and-gestures-together-for-remote-control/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/12/watch-out-surface-gesturetek-is-straight-frontin/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mobileworldcongress.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=361&lt;/ref&gt;

GestureTek’s gesture interface applications include multi-touch and 3D camera tracking.  GestureTek’s [[multi-touch]] technology powers the multi-touch table in Melbourne’s [[Eureka Tower]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aboutmicrosoftsurface.com/microsoft-surface-versus-gesturetek-illuminate-table.php&lt;/ref&gt;.  A GestureTek multi-touch table with [[object recognition]] is found at the New York City Visitors Center&lt;ref&gt;http://svconline.com/corporateav/features/new_york_information_center_409/&lt;/ref&gt;. Telefonica has a [[multi-touch]] window with technology from GestureTek&lt;ref&gt;http://deals.venturebeat.com/2007/12/12/gesturetek-receives-investment-from-telefonica/&lt;/ref&gt;. GestureTek’s 3D tracking technology is used in a [[3D television]] prototype from Hitachi and various digital signage and display solutions based on 3D interaction&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lcdtvreviews.org.uk/lcd-news/hitachi-gesturetek-collaboration-to-realise-bare-hand-tv-remote-control/&lt;/ref&gt;.

GestureTek currently has 8 patents awarded, including: 5,534,917&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5534917.html?query=PN%2F5534917+OR+5534917&amp;stemming=on&lt;/ref&gt; (Video Gesture Control Motion Detection); 7,058,204 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7058204.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Multiple Camera Control System, Point to Control Base Patent); 7,421,093 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7421093.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Multiple Camera Tracking System for Interfacing With an Application); 7,227,526 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7227526.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Stereo Camera Control, 3D-Vision Image Control System); 7,379,563 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7379563.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Two Handed Movement Tracker Tracking Bi-Manual Movements); 7,379,566 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/7379566.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Optical Flow-Based Tilt Sensor For Phone Tilt Control); 7,389,591 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7389591.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Phone Tilt for Typing &amp; Menus/Orientation-Sensitive Signal Output); 7,430,312 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7430312.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Five Camera 3D Face Capture).  

GestureTek’s software and patents have been licensed by [[Microsoft]] for the [[XBOX 360]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11215&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Sony]] for the EyeToy&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Feb_18/ai_n9546647/?tag=content;col1&lt;/ref&gt;, NTT DoCoMo for their mobile phones&lt;ref&gt;http://iq4m.com/Track_Record.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hasbro]] for the ION Educational Gaming System&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/news/mobile-phone/?story=17395&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to software provision, GestureTek also fabricates interactive gesture control display systems with [[natural user interface]] for interactive advertising, games and presentations.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/video_gallery.php?v=1586&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, GestureTek’s natural user interface virtual reality system has been the subject of research by universities and hospitals for its application in both [[physical therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=546410&lt;/ref&gt; and [[physical rehabilitation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://hw.haifa.ac.il/occupa/LIRT/vr.htm. Retrieved on 2009-05-07&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2008, GestureTek received the Mobile Innovation Global Award&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wirelessweek.com/Article-FirstNews_February13_2008.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; from the GSMA for its software-based, gesture-controlled user interface for mobile games and applications.  The technology is used by Java platform integration providers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplixcorp.com/en/release/pdf/20080630.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and mobile developers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamezone.com/news/12_19_08_11_48AM.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Katamari Damacy]] is one example of a gesture control mobile game powered by GestureTek software.
