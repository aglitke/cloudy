## Instance Creation
##  These variables affect the creation of cloudy VM instances

# Each VM is created with a telnet-style serial port.  This variable
# controls the starting port number of the block that will be used.
SERIAL_PORT_BASE=3110

# Set the amount of memory that will be given to each VM
MEM=$(( 1 * 1024 * 1024 ))

# Set the starting MAC address to be used when creating VMs.
MAC_BASE="de:ad:be:ef:00:"

# The network can be configured in one of two ways:
# bridge:  VMs will be connected directly to the LAN via the identified
#          bridge. You must specify NET_BRIDGE
# XXX: Only bridge is supported at the moment.
# network: Connect the VMs to a defined libvirt network.  You must specify
#          the network name in NET_NETWORK
NETWORK_MODE=bridge
NET_BRIDGE=br0
